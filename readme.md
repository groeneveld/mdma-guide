This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information. Drawing on memory-reconsolidation/predictive-processing, complex systems dynamics, and the defense cascade model of autonomic threat responses, the authors explain how MDMA facilitates the unlearning of the maladaptive schemas/predictions underlying many mental illnesses. The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one. Iâ€™ve edited it. The book itself is 100% human-written.
