Initial visceral MDMA insights
\begin{itemize}
    \item Priors are not fundamentally true; they are heuristics created by historic events.
    \item On a practical level, insecurity and trauma create the maladaptive (casually defined) schemas that cause people to hurt other people.
    \item More fundamentally, many adaptive (casually defined) schemas are also maladaptive because they're doing local optimization at the expense of global optimization. They're based on the incorrect assumption that that individual's suffering/wellbeing matters more than other individuals' suffering/wellbeing.
    \item There is a deep well of fundamentally inviolable safety and okness inside me.
    \item Suffering is somehow just a misunderstanding of how things are.
    \item Temporally distant fear/anger/sadness schemas are likely incorrect. Temporally immediate fear/anger schemas are likely adaptive, but that assiciated suffering is still somehow a misunderstanding.
    \item There is fundamental peace/okness that craving and aversion disrupt.
\end{itemize}
