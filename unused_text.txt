Psychedelics are capable of catalyzing important insights but they (less so MDMA) are also capable of generating a wide variety of compelling yet ungrounded conceptual hallucinations. Psychedelics increase the strength of your imagination, thereby weakening your mind's ability to differentiate between reality and imaginary \cite{quantaRealityImagination}. Please critique your insights with mainstream academic philosophy, neuroscience, and physics before concluding that the tree next to you harbors malevolent intentions or that the entity you talked to was real. It was in all likelihood a construct of your subconscious mind.


The "three month rule" started out as Anne Shuglin's educated guess for how often you can take MDMA while maintaining long-term effectiveness. While she was a respected psychedelic researcher, one person's guess is not a reliable guideline. Many people use MDMA more often than three months and don't experience a decline of effect. 

If you are significantly constrained by time, care resources, or critical responsibilities, you should take care to not go too deep in one session, otherwise you might get into a too-much-too-soon scenario and experience more destabilization than you can handle.

We suspect that such an individual would actually have an even deeper attachment to living that would override their desire to not be alive, but they could hypothetically unlearn the not-falling-off-a-cliff schema before they unlearn the wanting-to-die schema.

Multiple psychedelic-therapy practitioners also believe that judiciously adding 0.5 g dried psilocybin mushrooms to the start of MDMA trips would further improve outcomes [M.G.'s observation and personal communications]. 

Another less durable mechanism in play is fear extinction. Here, a second emotional memory of safety is overlaid upon the first painful memory. Both memories exist and the safe overlay has to be explicitly and repetitively trained for every context where you don't want the stuck emotional memory to activate. Because fear extinction is shallow and fragile, reconsolidation is preferable. Activating and staying present with stuck emotional memories during therapy reliably prioritizes reconsolidation. While you may have to reconsolidate multiple parts of a memory, once you do, the emotional tone of the memory should feel greatly diminished or transformed.

Even if the current scientific grasp of reconsolidation isn't perfect, focusing on strong mismatches proves effective. This might indicate that if reconsolidation isn't what is happening in the brain, the true process is similar.

Dissociation may be an information disconnection between brain regions that psychedelics forcefully reconnect. 

As an example, here is one maximum speed schedule that the author [M.G.] would have done with hindsight: \todo{include what support I should have had}
\textit{Three guided PSIP sessions at the start. Let out neurogenic tremors as much as possible throughout the healing journey and after.
MDMA + 0.5 g dried mushroom session once every 6 weeks. Spend abundant time walking in nature, pondering my past, transcribing recorded MDMA sessions, etc.
30ug LSD sessions twice a week to bring up minor stuck emotional memories that I could process. Eventually the minor stuck emotional memories ran out, and the sessions started going to the major stuck emotional memories, which felt unbearable. I stopped using LSD at that point.}



\section{Body-Scan Meditation}
\label{bodyScan}
The aim of this body scan meditation is to cultivate awareness and identify areas in the body where stress or trauma-related feelings might be stored. This can help in understanding and processing these feelings.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Find a Comfortable Position:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Lying Down:} Lay on a mat or comfortable surface, ensuring your entire body is supported. Place your arms slightly away from the body, palms facing up.
        \item \textbf{Seated:} If you prefer sitting, choose a chair or cushion. Ensure your back is straight, feet are flat on the ground, and hands rest on your lap.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Close Your Eyes:} Begin by taking several deep breaths. As you inhale, feel the air fill your lungs. As you exhale, imagine releasing any immediate tension.
    \item \textbf{Begin at the Feet:} Focus your attention on your toes, then the soles of your feet, progressing to the heels and up to the ankles. Notice any sensations - be it warmth, coolness, tension, tingling, or even numbness. If you sense areas of tension or discomfort that might be related to stress or trauma, acknowledge them without judgment.
    \item \textbf{Progress Upward Slowly:} Move your attention up through the body, section by section – calves, knees, thighs, pelvis, stomach, chest, back, shoulders, arms, hands, neck, face, and the top of your head. At each section, pause for a moment to notice sensations and any feelings of tension or unease.
    \item \textbf{Observe without Judgment:} If you identify areas that seem to hold trauma or stress, simply observe without trying to change, judge, or interpret. Your role is to be an observer, bringing these areas into your conscious awareness.
    \item \textbf{Breathe into Tension:} When you encounter a spot holding tension or trauma feelings, imagine breathing into that area on the inhale and releasing tension on the exhale. This can promote relaxation and release.
    \item \textbf{Complete the Scan:} Once you've observed every section of your body, take a few more deep breaths. Reflect on the experience, acknowledging any insights or sensations you've encountered.
    \item \textbf{Return Slowly:} When you feel ready, wiggle your fingers and toes, bringing movement back to the body. If lying down, turn to one side and push yourself up to a seated position. Open your eyes and take a moment to transition back to your surroundings.
\end{enumerate}
Body scan meditation can bring up intense emotions, especially when focused on trauma. It's important to approach the practice with self-compassion. Remember, this is a tool for awareness and healing, so be gentle with yourself.


This manual starts with an overview of trauma, how the mind and body respond to trauma, and the mechanisms of healing. Then we discuss the outcomes of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy clinical trials, compare MDMA-therapy to other methods, and discuss drug interactions, medical contraindications, psychological risks, common concerns, and dosing. Next we cover session planning and expectations, recommendations for conducting the session, making sense of the session afterwards, continued healing, making positive life-changes, and managing pacing and technique to minimize destabilization. Finally, there is troubleshooting, complementary practices and medicines, and recommended books and tools. \todo{move to abstract?}

Stuck emotional memories and their associated defenses are sometimes called different things based on the intensity of their impact on your life. "Trauma" and "mental illness" are often used for major experiences and "unprocessed emotions", "emotional baggage", "residual stress", "hang-ups", or "emotional triggers" are often used for minor experiences, though this categorization is imprecise. Other than intensity and impact, the distinction between major and minor is not important, as both work in similar ways, have similar negative impacts on your wellbeing, cause similar, often harmful defenses, and should be healed in similar ways. This guide will prefer the term "stuck emotional memory" to avoid the unnecessary connotations of the other terms, and to emphasize the emotional component of the memory rather than the episodic component. "Healing" will be used as a broad term that includes memory reconsolidation, gaining insight, learning of skills, and more.

While not every citation was reviewed, most were carefully selected as valuable resources. We have tried to prioritize freely available sources that don't use unnecessarily technical language, but sometimes rigor or comprehensiveness took precedence. Some references contain both DOI and URL links. The DOI is a stable link to the publisher's webpage for the article. The URL links to a less stable full-text document on another website when the full text isn't available from the publisher.

If any type of trauma therapy is successful and continued until there aren't many stuck emotional memories left, you can expect long-lasting, durable healing of most stuck fears, maladaptive defenses, mental illnesses, and some psychosomatic and stress-aggravated illnesses (some may not be reversible, or only reversible with additional life changes or medical tools). These states may arise again in response to new trauma or old unhealed triggers, but you will now have tools to get unstuck again. If all trauma-therapy is discontinued while you're in a destabilized state, that destabilization has the potential to persist long-term.


In certain contexts, activities like crying, physical activity, yelling, laughter, rituals, singing, talking, or art can also heal, with different activities working for different people \cite{rottenbergCrying}. They reduce a heightened ANS state, enabling calmer exploration of emotional memories. They may also facilitate reconsolidation through bringing the memory into extended focus and increasing mismatch though release of various good-feeling neurochemicals.

 Almost all deaths involving MDMA are caused by heat stroke from dehydration, hot environments, and prolonged dancing \cite{hubermanMDMA}. Heat stroke is not a concertn in typical therapeutic contexts.

 The placebo results are similar to other forms of non-medicine-assisted professionally guided therapy \cite{otaloraMDMA}

 While expert assistance can be invaluable at challenging moments during the healing journey, we won't reiterate this throughout this manual unless there is an exceptional risk.

, especially if others depend on your stability for their basic needs.

 MDMA also has medical contraindications, addressed in Section \ref{sectionSafety}.

    \item Absence of personality disorders, psychotic disorders, mania or depression significant enough to cause hospitalization, or severely impaired impulse control \cite{colemanPsychedelicPsychotherapy}. We think these conditions may be amenable to MDMA healing with expert guidance and an abundance of care and planning.


MDMA is an empathogen, ("generating a state of empathy"), also possessing minor psychedelic ("mind manifesting") properties. 

While some claim supplements can reduce post-session exhaustion, their efficacy isn't well-supported by scientific evidence \cite{hubermanMDMA}.

. A drug's concentration in the blood decreases by half during each half-life period. For example, after one half-life, 50\% of the drug remains; after two half-lives, 25\% remains, and so on. The half-life of MDMA is 8 hours \cite{torrePharmacology}.

 (Hours 0.25 to 0.75)
 (Hours 0.75 to 4)
 (Hours 4 to 6)
 (Hours 5 to 24)

 Although reconsolidation may still occur at a slower pace, you might need to use additional effort to focus on distressing schemas.

    \item \textit{Why Zebras don't get Ulcers} by Robert Sapolsky, Ph.D. Sapolsky discusses how chronic stress affects human health, drawing parallels between humans and other animals. He combines humor and research to provide insights into managing stress \cite{sapolskyZebra}.

The usage and prominence of these defense mechanisms can vary widely based on individual experiences, cultural factors, and personal development. While many of these mechanisms can be healthy in certain contexts, they can become problematic if overused or if they hinder overall emotional growth or understanding. For more thorough coverage see \textit{Why Do I Do That?: Psychological Defense Mechanisms and the Hidden Ways They Shape Our Lives} by Joseph Burgo Ph.D. \cite{burgoDefenseMechanisms,cramerDefenses}.

While defenses are unconscious, people also use conscious methods called coping strategies to manage their distress \cite{lazarusCoping}. These can take a variety of adaptive  and maladaptive forms, such as exercise, drinking alcohol, or avoiding triggering situations.

 R. Coleman's \textit{Psychedelic Psychotherapy} for a wealth of information \cite{colemanPsychedelicPsychotherapy}.

This built on a history of drug prohibition and stigmatization that predates this era. 

        We note that you could add psilocybin, an anti-addictive medicine, at the start of your MDMA session (see Section \ref{sec:dissociationandresistance}) if you feel susceptible \cite{principeAddiction}. It will expose you more directly to distressing repressed emotions and your experience will likely be unpleasant, while likely increasing the depth of healing.

\item \textbf{Psychosis}
        Psychedelics uncommonly trigger temporary psychosis in those with a personal or family history of psychosis or bipolar disorder \cite{schlagPsychedelicAdverseEffects}. We suggest expert guidance may allow safe use of these medicines even with those contraindications. There are almost no recorded incidents of psychedelics inducing psychosis in those without a personal or family history. Psychosis, while strongly affected by genetic and social factors, generally requires triggering by trauma. MDMA is more of an empathogen than a psychedelic, but it also facilitates the surfacing of distressing emotional memories and could conceivably trigger temporary psychosis in those with a personal or family history.

 This could be explained if maladaptive schemas are a necessary (but not necessarily sufficient) component of the large majority of mental illness \cite{vanderKolkBody}. Maladaptive schemas are healed through reconsolidation, and we hypothesize that traditional psychiatric drugs may not assist that process, though appropriate use can help you stabilize in some situations. A variety of psychiatric drugs may also inhibit reconsolidation \cite{laneReconsolidation}.



\textbf{Example schedule \#1 (typical):}
\textit{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Enough PSIP sessions to enable non-medicine-assisted psychogenic tremoring. Guidance may be necessary. Use tremoring as needed when you are outside the therapeutic window or otherwise want to deactivate.
        \item MDMA sessions every 6 weeks. Adjust frequency as you gain experience. A higher frequency may be justified if you are not able to make significant progress without MDMA or if you need to make faster progress to meet various goals.
        \item Coherence therapy every day when you notice maladaptive schemas.
        \item As much journaling, nature walks, body-movement practices, etc. as needed to make sense of how trauma affected you.
    \end{itemize}
}
\noindent \textbf{Example schedule \#2 (max-speed):}
\textit{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Enough PSIP sessions to enable non-medicine-assisted psychogenic tremoring. Guidance may be necessary. Use tremoring as needed when you are outside the therapeutic window or otherwise want to deactivate.
        \item MDMA sessions every 3 weeks to continually stay in a critical period where daily reconsolidation is more effective. Adjust the frequency if your post-MDMA session critical period is more or less than 3 weeks. The safety of MDMA-therapy as this frequency has not been rigorously studied. Some may find this frequency worth doing if they are deeply dysfunctional.
        \item Coherence therapy every day when you notice maladaptive schemas. Keep going until you're exhausted. Adding 5 $\mu$g LSD may help. Small-dose LSD session of 30 $\mu$g up to twice a week may serve a similar role.
        \item As much journaling, nature walks, body-movement practices, etc. as needed to make sense of how trauma affected you.
    \end{itemize}

Because of the dangers of manic and psychotic episodes, we only recommend experimenting with MDMA-therapy for those conditions if existing treatments are inadequate, and then only in the physical presence of a professional with a strong capacity to treat these conditions, understanding of MDMA-therapy, and effective symptom oversight and management (including the ability to prescribe psychiatric medication).

 This method can also ease challenging tasks, like difficult conversations, by associating them with empathy. For this, have such conversations during an MDMA session once you're familiar with the therapy. Make sure to ask for informed consent from your conversation partner.

When it does happen, stress of therapeutic destabilization is likely a major factor in triggering episodes in genetically-susceptible people \cite{winkelPsychosisStress}. 

Further studies investigating more health measures, longer-term MDMA use, larger numbers of participants, or higher-risk populations may discover currently unknown adverse effects.

We think MDMA neurotoxicity is highly unlikely in humans in therapeutic contexts \cite{passieHistory,halpernMormonRavers}. However, MDMA is known to cause oxidative stress in the brain at very high doses in animal tests. This may also happen at sufficiently high doses in humans, though it has not been demonstrated. 

    \item The target issue may involve schemas you don't fully understand or regularly experience. Once the schema is made explicit in therapy, you may not be able to avoid overwhelming feelings in daily life.

    \item Challenging insights about one's past, behavior, or beliefs may provoke difficult emotions.
    
        \item Coping behaviors or beliefs may fall away as inner stability increases, or as a result of insight. This change is usually healthy in the long term, but the lack of a familiar coping pattern may be hard to deal with in the short term.

    \item In the Internal Family Systems framework, some schemas termed "protectors" facilitate emotional stability by pushing us to avoid distressing thoughts or emotions \cite{schwartz2019internal}. Protectors can increase in intensity when the overwhelming feelings they push us to avoid are engaged with during therapy. This is termed protector backlash.
    
    Difficult emotions may become more noticeable as dissociation decreases.
    
    Emotional numbing is a category of mental and/or physiological states we invent to capture anecdotes we have heard of how some people seem to "not feel anything" during MDMA-therapy, but are not always clearly immobile. We are unsure of the nature or validity of this phenomena. It may be some extreme form of avoidance, an atypical form of opioid-mediated defense cascade activation, an opioid-mediated phenomena not in the defense cascade, immobility where the immobility aspect is counteracted by MDMA-induced stimulation, something else, multiple things, or a mistaken category that doesn't actually exist. Here is one example that highlights this category: "People with significant State-4 [a high level of dissociation] may have very little or no response to substances as powerful as MDMA or psilocybin. They will feel sober, or bored or sleepy as if they could get up and go about their day \cite{razviPSIP}." We don't think someone experiencing one of the dissociative defense cascade states of tonic or collapsed immobility would want to "get up and go about their day." This highlights the possibility that there is a category of dissociative state that doesn't match up well with the defense cascade model. Whatever the nature of this category, \textcite{razviPSIP} reports consistent success reducing the dissociation by "...bringing blankness, flat affect, nothingness, boredom, sleepiness, or sobriety into focus." Then, "In a psychedelic-assisted session, it might take staying with it from minutes to a full day-long session, but it will crack." If this category is opioid-mediated, naloxone may help, as mentioned above \cite{escamilla2023treatment}.

These protective factors reduce risk of trauma through a range of mechanisms that improve a person's ability to experience potentially traumatic events in a way that holds a unified meaning for them. That is to say, a person who has many of these factors acting in their support when they experience a potentially traumatic event will be more likely to encode the memory with a single meaning across their somatic, emotional, and narrative/cognitive memory. For instance, a child whose caregiver is explosively violent towards them a single time is likely to carry different meanings of that event in they somatic, emotional, and narrative systems. Somatic systems may recall fear by activating the nervous system when triggers related to the event return. Emotionally, the child may experience anger, but they may instead experience self-doubt or self-blame (especially if they are dependent on the caregiver for survival)--regardless of whether they behaved inappropriately in the slightest. Narratively, the child may remember the events in the same way an outside observer would likely recount them, or they they may not remember them at all, or they may distort the events to amplify their own misbehavior prior to the caregiver violence--in alignment with their emotional memory. If the caregiver in question takes accountability, names what has happened, appolgizes to the child, and takes active observable steps towards preventing future repetitions of the harm, this greatly reduces the child's need to create such dissociated memory and meaning around the event. This is one example of how healthy support from other people can function to reduce the risk of trauma. In general, the protective factors on this list, in one way or another, are likely to similairy reduce risk of dissociation, and therefore risk of pathological truama response.

There are a variety of neural systems activated in the defense cascade, including possibly two opioid systems ($\mu$-opioid and $\kappa$-opioid), each associated with different effects. Different combinations of system activations produce different symptom sets, and these may not always neatly line up with the above list of defense cascade states. Alternatively, this might just be a mild form of immobility. Dissociation is present in a wide variety of psychological disorders. 

\textcite{colcott2024side} published a side-effect meta-analysis of MDMA-therapy trials and found that MDMA therapy "...is associated with greater likelihood of experiencing mild to moderate, but largely transient side effects. Findings, however, need to be interpreted cautiously due to limitations of the existing evidence." The statistically significant side effects included, starting from the most common: dilated pupils, feeling jittery, uncontrolled eye movements, excessive perspiration, chills, blurred vision, jaw clenching/tight jaw, muscle tightness, decreased appetite, restlessness, non-cardiac chest pain/discomfort, feeling cold, and nausea. We are unclear which of these symptoms are due to schema-related defense cascade activation and which are due to MDMA itself. Larger trials would help us better understand rare, potentially more serious, side-effects that haven't appeared in these relatively small trials. Side effects were also measured by spontaneous self-report. Systematic measurement with checklists would likely report more side effects.

 In traditional psychotherapy where mismatch is provided by the client's existing knowledge, this generally does not happen \footnote{There might be rare situations where a healthy schema is unlearned. Someone's deep desire to not be alive might be able to contradict their desire to, say, avoid falling off a cliff because that would cause their death. In that case their not-falling-off-a-cliff schema could be an un-integrated remnant from a time in their life when they did want to be alive.} \todo{cite ecker email on footnote?}, because, a

We are unclear on the exact nature of the mismatch that MDMA provides. However, we suspect it involves intense feelings of compassion and safety in the present moment that feels true and important (Possibly because in all likelihood you really are safe in the moment and your maladaptive schemas usually prevent you from feeling that truth. The same for compassion; you and other beings really do have inherent worth and when we do hurtful things, it's for reasons one can understand.). Compassion and safety contradict the negative expectations or disregard for others or self involved in most maladaptive schemas. Compassion and safety are unlikely to contradict healthy schemas that protect you or others from harm. If this mechanism is correct, it may indicate that conducting MDMA therapy in genuinely unsafe environments could unlearn healthy protective schemas. 

There are a variety of neural systems activated in the defense cascade, including possibly two opioid systems ($\mu$-opioid and $\kappa$-opioid), each associated with different effects. Different combinations of system activations produce different symptom sets, and these may not always neatly line up with the above list of defense cascade states. 

A variety of low-quality studies from the mid-20th century generally reported symptom improvement after administering LSD to individuals with schizophrenia \cite{sapienza2024psychedelics}. We're not sure how this applies to MDMA-therapy.

The contraindications listed here are a best-effort list and may not be comprehensive. We advise always checking with the scientific literature, a doctor, or a pharmacist if you regularly use another medicine, need to use another drug within 24 hours on either side of an MDMA session, or have a potentially relevant health condition. You may need to abstain from some medicines for two weeks before it's safe to use MDMA \cite{malcolmSerotonin,edinoffInteractions}. \todo{emphasize 3 ways to avoid problems}


None of those methods working may be a sign that MDMA doesn't work with your brain chemistry.

    \item MDMA has multiple interactions with the cardiovascular system that create risk for those with some cardiovascular problems \cite{bonsignoreCardio} \footnote{We think Bonsignore doesn't control well for polydrug use and also doesn't take enough caution translating high-dose rodent studies to human therapeutic use. However, we haven't been able to find any better source of information on the topics.}. These risks are further exacerbated by high doses or long-term high-frequency use.


 If you do abuse MDMA, the adverse effects are likely lower than those of most drugs of abuse, possibly because tolerance usually makes abuse self-limiting \cite{nuttDrugHarms}.

 You can also do body scan meditation (Part of Appendix \ref{MBSR} describes this technique) to see if the dissociation feels present in a certain part of your body and send the love there.

You can also try deliberately triggering schemas by looking at photographs or letters, doing a safe activity which triggers the memory, or engaging in a practice that helps you process emotions such as music or art. \todo{Should this really be recommended? It worked for me once but IDK if it's a good strategy in general. If not, also change elsewhere in paper.}

    \item Transitioning to a "whole-food, plant-based" diet for a large risk reduction for many chronic illnesses and significantly reduced environmental impact \cite{WillettEATLancet}. We suggest the Forks over Knives guide \cite{forks}. \todo{impact on mental health} \todo{better way to do this? the guide we cite is triggering}

If your concern is with the pharmaceutical industry's reputation, it may help to know that MDMA-therapy has been successfully used for decades by underground therapists before the clinical trials were started by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) \cite{passieHistory}. MAPS is a hybrid organization with non-profit and public benefit corporation components and donations have provided most of its funding. Also take care to establish the quality of your medicine, possibly using a test kit. \todo{strongman evil drug argument. Example aspirin. Refinement is good. }

        If your concern is with the medicine coming from a lab vs a plant or fungi, consider that those chemical pathways are not fundamentally different \cite{naturalProducts}. Plants and fungi use many of the same chemical reactions used in a lab. Many natural substances are also toxic and cause acute or chronic damage. \todo{not relevant concern. Supplements have a poor track record, chemically isolated medicines do}

 The effects of psychedelics are context-dependent \cite{nardouMDMAPlasticity}.

    \item Two doses of 5 mg/kg on consecutive days may increase long-term anxiety-like behavior in rats \cite{baumannRats}. Doses of 10-20 mg/kg have been shown to cause serotonin system dysfunction in rats. Doses over 25 mg/kg are clearly neurotoxic in rats. We suggest the safe dose limit is far lower than these numbers to account for individual differences and a margin of error. We suggest limiting doses to 120mg plus a 60mg booster, as was used in the clinical trials, as a precaution. \todo{comment on mg/kg vs fixed size} \todo{inaccurate because of injection vs oral}


This section is written assuming some familiarity with the theory and practice of healing maladaptive emotions, beliefs, and behaviors, and managing resistance, destabilization, and autonomic nervous system states. The rest of this manual is written assuming no knowledge of the topic at all. 

\subsubsection{Feeling less motivated} \todo{why did I include this one?}
Some schemas use unhealthy fear to motivate us (e.g. "Devoting all my energy to this project will prove that I'm not a bad person"). Therapy can reconsolidate this fear-based motivating schema before you develop healthier motivation. We suggest further reconsolidation and engagement with the world will reveal and develop healthier motivations.

\item \textbf{Safety Mapping}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Imagine a safe, comforting place. Add multiple vivid sensations to the memory to increase its power.
        \item Set boundaries around triggering items.
    \end{itemize}

        \item Somatic Experiencing: Focuses on noticing and processing bodily sensations \cite{levineSomatic}. \todo{link to details}

Many find Somatic Experiencing, a related technique of tracking and processing bodily sensations, useful, though no high-quality studies have examined it \cite{kuhfußSomatic}. \textit{Healing Trauma, A Pioneering Program for Restoring the Wisdom of Your Body} by Peter Levine Ph.D. is a good resource for further information and techniques \cite{levineSomatic}.

\subsection{*Body-Connection Medicines}
\todo{a bit woo; probably excise}
Low-dose combinations of LSD and THC taken at the same time can produce a good-feeling and powerful body-awareness \cite{colemanPsychedelicPsychotherapy}. M.G reports a positive experience with 10 $\mu$g LSD and 1.5 mg edible THC and no existing tolerance. This can be deeply healing to those who have been perpetually disconnected from their bodies, a common effect of trauma \cite{vanderKolkBody}. These low doses will likely produce a small alteration of consciousness. At these low doses the primary contraindications of LSD are pregnancy, serious liver and kidney diseases, brain disorders, or personal or family history of psychosis or bipolar disorder \cite{schlagPsychedelicAdverseEffects,passiePsycholytic}. The contraindications of THC are psychosis, severe bipolar disorder, severe cardiovascular, immunological, liver, or kidney disease, especially in acute illness \cite{DCCannabis}.

\subsection{Coherence Therapy}
\todo{incorporate technique of intertwined identification and disconfirmation}
Coherence Therapy addresses emotional and behavioral patterns through the lens of schemas \cite{eckerUnlocking}. The goal is to unearth these schemas, confront them with contradictory experiences, and thus facilitate their reconsolidation. Here's a simplified model: \todo{what does coherence mean? why does this make sense?} \todo{make an example and work through it with each technique}

\noindent \textbf{Accessing Sequence:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Symptom Identification: Start by identifying a recurring, unwanted emotional or behavioral reaction or belief that seems involuntary, beyond conscious control.
    \item Identification of Target Schema: Reflect on the origin of this reaction. Consider its past occurrences and try to remember its inception. Documenting your introspection might reveal events or situations that birthed this deep-seated schema. \todo{hard, how make easier? therapist can help. tools (prompts we mention above, thought records)?}
    \item Identification of Disconfirming Knowledge: Choose whether you want to disconfirm the belief or emotional memory component of the schema. One may feel more fundamental than the other and disconfirming it may provide deeper healing. Identify experiences or understandings that challenge or oppose this schema component. \todo{is one really more fundamental}
\end{itemize}
\noindent \textbf{Erasure Sequence:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reactivation of the Target Schema: Activate the target schema, perhaps by reliving related emotions or memories.
    \item Activation of Disconfirming Knowledge, Mismatching the Target Schema: Simultaneously hold in mind both the old truth and the current experiences that challenge it. Feel the tension or contradiction between them. This direct emotional juxtaposition is the essence of Coherence Therapy and serves as the catalyst for the dissolution of the outdated schema. The tension dissipates after minutes to tens of minutes, indicating completion of reconsolidation. Focusing on the physical sensations of the disconfirming experience may increase mismatch since activating multiple aspects (touch, taste, etc.) of a memory make it stronger \cite{brownAttachmentDisturbances,mayerMultimedia}. \todo{thought record}  \todo{is somatic visualization the term for this?}
    \item Repetitions of the Target-Disconfirmation Pairing: Schemas often feel like complex networks of multiple memories, beliefs, emotions, and triggers. The previous step only reconsolidates the portion activated during that session. Repetition is necessary as different triggers activate remaining parts of the network.
\end{itemize}
\noindent \textbf{Verification:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reflective Self-Assessment: Reflect on the initial triggers and schema. Do they feel different now?
    \item Mental Imagery Evaluation: "Visualize situations that previously evoked the initial reaction. Note any changes in your emotional response.
\end{itemize}
For on-the-spot reconsolidation of daily-activated schemas: Recognize the schema, identify opposing experiences, and activate the opposing experience. Memories of profound MDMA experiences can provide a universal mismatch if you can't identify the target schema or a disconfirming experience. \todo{also need to sit with schemas}

Coherence Therapy requires more cognitive effort than MDMA-therapy, but is fundamentally similar. Activation of target schemas and disconfirming experiences (here it is the effects of MDMA) are more automatic and intense in MDMA-therapy, achieving deeper reconsolidation with less effort and thinking. Memories of powerful MDMA experiences can serve as exceptionally effective disconfirming experiences for a range of maladaptive schemas. \todo{talk about lack of critical period for non-psychedelic therapy}

\subsection{Somatic Healing with THC}
\todo{no evidence, probably excise; might be worthwhile to try but may compromise reputation of paper}
\label{psip}
When dissociation is blocking other methods of healing, you can deactivate the ANS and reconsolidate stuck schemas by working through the bodily manifestation of stress \cite{razviPSIP}. First, prepare by spending an hour engaging with your sensations and relaxing your body via deep breathing \todo{an hour may be too hard for some people, a shower, or another method [personal communication with Jessica Sojorne Libere]. Second, a small dose of THC is taken to heighten bodily awareness. Third, locate the stress in your body with body-scan meditation (see Appendix \ref{MBSR}) or a similar technique. When you find it, you can either:} \todo{What does tremoring actually do? Unclear.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Surround the stress with love and compassion until it dissipates, thus reconsolidating the associated memory. This will become easier to do without THC or a guide as you practice.
    \item Shake your body to induce neurogenic tremoring, an important natural process that returns the ANS to a relaxed state \cite{berceliTremor,razviPSIP}. We often unconsciously avoid this because we fear loss of control, associate tremoring with stigma, or are taught to suppress it. Re-engaging with it can permanently reduce dissociation and anxiety if your ANS was stuck in an activated state. The deactivation may be temporary if a maladaptive schema re-triggers the ANS, though tremoring can be used as much as you want to keep deactivating it. Reconsolidation is now possible once dissociation and panic are relaxed, and you regain contact with your body. We have observed that tremoring can become spontaneous when relaxed and can be temporarily halted if needed. If tremoring is not possible, stay present with the dissociation or panic and gently inhibit thoughts, small movements, and comforting impulses (called Selective Inhibition in the Psychedelic Somatic Interactional Psychotherapy (PSIP) model. See Section \ref{selectiveInhibition}). Maintaining Selective Inhibition for tens of minutes will likely start deactivating the ANS and induce tremoring.
\end{enumerate}
We know some can do this on their own, but an experienced guide is required if the THC impairs your executive control. The contraindications of THC are psychosis, severe bipolar disorder, severe cardiovascular, immunological, liver, or kidney disease, especially in acute illness \cite{DCCannabis}.

There is little evidence that even lower sub-perceptual doses called microdosing improve mental health \cite{politoMicrodosing}.

\item \textit{Healing the Fragmented Selves of Trauma Survivors} by Janina Fisher, Ph.D. "...integrates a neurobiologically informed understanding of trauma, dissociation, and attachment with a practical approach to treatment \cite{fisherFragmented}."

\subsection{*Common Maladaptive Schemas}
\todo{Would probably be better as glossary of common language for maladaptive behaviors. Unclear on utility of this section.}
\label{ref:defenses}
All schemas were at some point defensive (protective) \cite{eckerUnlocking}. We suggest some of these overlap with what the psychodynamic framework calls defense mechanisms. Here are some common ones \cite{vaillantAdaptation}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Psychosis} Denial or distortion of external reality. Sometimes involves delusions of persecution.
    
    \item \textbf{Projection} Attributing one's own unacceptable feelings or thoughts to others.
    \item \textbf{Passive-Aggressive Behavior} Expressing hostility or anger in non-assertive ways.
    
    \item \textbf{Intellectualization} A pattern of perceived dispassionate and rational thought that hides distressing emotions. It is similar to rationalization and magical thinking.
    \item \textbf{Repression} General unawareness of emotions, memory, or senses.
    \item \textbf{Displacement} Taking out emotions on people or objects that aren't the actual cause of the issue.
    \item \textbf{Reaction Formation} Behaving in a way that's opposite to one's genuine feelings.
\end{itemize}

*Several other phenomena also explain the behavior of traumatized people \cite{laneReconsolidation}. Partially surfaced schemas push us to excessively focus on related emotional stimuli, a phenomenon known as emotional congruence. Intense emotions also strengthen memory formation, making traumatic memories especially prominent.

MAPS has two MDMA-therapy playlists on Spotify \cite{mapsMusicA,mapsMusicB}.     \item Music is commonly used to evoke distressing emotional memories \cite{mithoeferManual}. We suggest creating art or music may also help you evoke distressing schemas.

Two doses of 5 mg/kg on consecutive days is known to possibly cause long-term side effects in rats \cite{baumannRats}. 

 MDMA-therapy afterglow is less-studied but shares some similarities \cite{sessaAfterglow}.

 Examples include individuals or groups of humans you don't like or don't approve of, the more intelligent non-human animals like great apes, elephants, and octopuses, and less intelligent animals like fish and insects. 

 While starting a session under stress from current events or memories is ok, refrain if you're overly fatigued or unstable. \todo{ask jess} \todo{family history of psychosis is strong indication is strong indication to go cautiously} Consecutive sessions without sufficient recovery amplify the risk of severe side effects like psychosis. You can proceed with a subsequent session even if you haven't fully integrated the insights from the previous one. \todo{self assessment}

Healing is a lifelong practice. The stresses of life may eventually create more stuck schemas, but now you will have more tools to process them.

Heat stroke from intense physical activity and dehydration can also cause brain damage \cite{yeoHeatStroke}.

MDMA benignly increases body temperature by 0.2-0.8$^{\circ}$C or 0.4-1.4$^{\circ}$F \cite{liechti2014effects}. 

4. defense cascade-deactivating techniques such as deep breathing, tremoring, and grounding can be essential to staying within the therapeutic window, and are complementary to MDMA during a session. 

MDMA's biological half life is 8.5 hours, however sessions typically only last 4-8 hours due to rapidly developed tolerance \cite{torrePharmacology,mithoeferManual,vizeliActuteEffects,farreTolerance}. Because of this tolerance, booster doses may not increase the beneficial subjective effects as much as the dose would suggest. We hypothesize that a greater therapeutic effect may be obtained for the same amount of MDMA by reducing dose but increasing session frequency, such that total mg MDMA/month remains constant. For example, instead of using a standard 120mg initial dose + 60mg booster dose once every 6 weeks, a 120mg dose once every 4 weeks may provide greater theraputic benefit on the same overall quantity of medicine. We are not aware of this hypothesis having been tested. This approach may be particularly useful for individuals doing solo MDMA therapy who also have an abundance of time. It may be less useful for expensive professionally guided sessions where it is worthwhile to trade a deeper or slightly extended session (probable 1.5 hour increase) for more recovery post-session. \todo{is this still relevent in light of non-linear dose-response of mdma?} \todo{ask expert who has done study design of mdma}

    \item Obtain reading material from the reading list in Section \ref{resources} if desired.


 If you do take supplements, we suggest a high level of caution when purchasing supplements, as false claims and inaccurate ingredient lists are pervasive in the supplement industry \cite{cohen2023Supplements}.
 
  We agree but also speculate that limited, pre-agreed touch like hand-holding may be ok with providers you have an existing high-trust relationship with. Feeling safe and confident telling the therapist no is also a prerequisite to touch. Saying no could be practiced in an MDMA session prior to actual hand-holding in a subsequent session, allowing the client to soberly reflect on how it felt for them. This should not escalate into any remotely sexual forms of touch. Sexual touch from others is not necessary to heal sexual trauma; only reactivation and mismatching of the relevant schemas is needed.

On the high side, distracting side-effects can start increasing at doses over 120 mg and may overtake desirable effects at doses over 160 mg in the average person \cite{bruntLinking}. 


We think MDMA-therapy is useful for a broad range of cases, but appears most promising in these cases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Professional guidance with possible transition to solo sessions with check-ins for cases resistant to conventional treatment.
    \item Professional guidance with transition to solo sessions with check-ins for individuals who lack the resources for frequent psychotherapy sessions.
    \item Solo use with no professional guidance with the following conditions: 1) lack of access to conventional treatments 2) ability to self-treat and experience destabilization with acceptable consequences 3) inadequate response to, or an inability to use other effective DIY treatments.
\end{itemize}



MDMA-therapy also reduced alcohol addiction among clinical trial participants \cite{nicholasAlcohol}.


We also suggest that MDMA can be overused when an individual wishes to accomplish a great amount of therapy quickly but does not understand the critical need for sufficient sleep between sessions or the quickly-developed tolerance to MDMA in the brain \cite{simon2020sleep,farreTolerance}. 


The indigenous communities who first discovered how to use psychedelic medicines for healing \cite{celidwen2023Indigenous,davisOneRiver}.

Resistance also includes networks of schemas that reinforce each other: Schema A is itself a stimuli for activating schema B. B then reinforces A with a negative stimulus, preventing A from adapting. Sometimes these networks of avoidance and reinforcement become complex and paralyzing. \todo{give examples}

When you feel the emotions and beliefs of the memory, you are feeling the part of that network that activated in response to a particular stimulus. 

We also recommend The MAPS Psychedelic Integration Workbook \cite{integrationHandbook}. \todo{do we?}

CBD also shows weak, preliminary promise for reducing anxiety \cite{skelleyCBD}. We also do not discuss its risks and benefits here.


    \item Some cases of personality disorder are likely treatable with MDMA-therapy \cite{traynorBorderline}. These conditions involve extremely strong resistance, and destabilization during therapy may be intense \cite{razviPSIP}. The process of MDMA-therapy will likely be more difficult and may benefit from additional support if that is accessible.
    
    
Despite effects being dependent on body mass, most data is only available from fixed dose studies. 


The phase III clinical trials found fixed doses consisting of an 80-120 mg initial dose followed by a half-strength supplemental dose administered 1.5-2 hours later were generally effective and safe for medically screened participants \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}.


We suggest practicing loving-kindness meditation for yourself and your dissociation or avoidance (see Appendix \ref{lkmeditation}). The feelings of compassion could ease down dissociation and resistance.



 
 
 
 
 
        
        Safrole harvesting in Southeast Asia often causes large-scale deforestation and species extinction \cite{safroleProduction}. We urge sustainable production that doesn't involve degradation of natural areas. However, we also urge you to not let this knowledge dissuade you from MDMA-therapy, given the importance of connection, care, and mental health. We also believe care for nature (see Section \ref{sec:nature}), and care and compassion for each other and future generations (see Section \ref{sec:circle}) are of paramount importance and were among the primary motivations for this manual. \todo{remove to avoid scaring people off?}
        
        
        MDMA addiction is rare to nonexistent in supportive therapeutic contexts where it has been formally studied \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2,mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial}. 
        
        
    \item When working with a therapist or guide: Your empathy and regard for each other, agreement on goals and methods, and therapist skill with facilitating reconsolidation. These factors impact outcomes more than the choice of therapeutic framework \cite{wampoldCommonFactors}.
    
    No clear statistical connection between recreational MDMA and suicidal ideation has been found, and correlational studies have had mixed results \cite{jonesSuicideAdults,jonesSuicideAdolescents,kimSuicide}. However, i
    
    
    The interactions between MDMA and many drugs remain uncertain, and self-experimentation could lead to unforeseen complications \cite{cohenMDMADrugCombinations,sarparastDrugInteractions}.
    
        \item Interactions with other medications. Ritonavir, opioids, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, stimulants, caffeine, anesthetics, MDMA metabolites or analogs, muscle relaxants, olanzapine, and metoclopramide may be particularly dangerous and occasionally deadly. Discontinuing medications for 5 drug half-lives before the session and restarting it  2 days after the session generally assures a significant amount (only 2\% remains) of the other drug won't be in your body at the same time as a significant amount of MDMA \todo{soso advice, need better}. As with MAOI's, this doesn't prevent all interaction problems. Discussing drug combinations with a doctor or pharmacist may be necessary.
        
            \item Combining bupropion with MDMA extends the therapeutic effects of MDMA by about 1 hour, while reducing heart rate and blood pressure \cite{schmid2015bupropion}. No adverse effects of this combination have been found.


 Caffeine also increases risk at high MDMA doses in rats \cite{vanattouCaffeine}.
 
 
 In a highly supportive setting with medical screening of participants, both phase 3 clinical trials measured no serious or long term adverse effects (among the set of outcomes they looked at) at 6-week spacing for 3 sessions with 180 mg MDMA (combined measure of primary and supplemental doses) \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial,mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}. Higher doses, more frequent sessions, and a greater number of sessions are likely safe, but it's unknown where the limits are and experimentation can be risky. Doing more than three sessions is likely safe but could potentially introduce unknown risks, which should be weighed against potential benefits. It is also possible that participants experienced a set of problems that the study was not capable of detecting.
 
 On a population level, recreational MDMA use leads to acute physical injury far less often than horse riding does, for instance \cite{nutt2009equasy}.
 
 As previously discussed, MDMA therapy commonly accelerates the processes of reconsolidation and therapeutic destabilization, the latter of which can be disruptive when intense or poorly managed.
 
 We only found one case study describing psychosis following a single purported dose. 
 
 Note that this study only investigated those who experienced new, persistent negative symptoms. Most psychedelic users do not experience these.

    \item MDMA-therapy has only been clinically tested at 6-week spacing \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}. There is little data regarding responsible recreational use but what we have has not shown clear long-term cognitive deficits even with a large number of lifetime doses \cite{halpernMormonRavers}. We are not aware of any high-quality investigation of long-term physical problems. It is not known where the limit of safety is, and it is likely different for different people. We can only suggest attempting to balance this unknown risk with the benefits MDMA-therapy brings to your life.
    
    
    
    We suggest wariness of charismatic people selling things, non-scientific mechanisms of action (false claims of scientific support are widespread), cure-all or quick-fix claims, or companies selling proprietary treatments (almost no currently available psychedelics are not under patent protection). 
    
    
    60% of adults experienced childhood trauma; half develop a mental illness in their
life. Symptoms like cognitive distortion, emotional rigidness/insecurity, and impaired compassion increase tribalism, political polarization, and apathy to animal suffering–hobbling our collective capacity to defeat global catastrophic risks. Access to effective care (a crucial support for stopping intergenerational harm) is inadequate for most who need
it. MDMA is a promising treatment, but good training is lacking because MDMA is illegal.
With legalization immanent, our rigorous and accessible guide to MDMA therapy will: 1) Resource therapeutic MDMA users and clinicians 2) Articulate likely mecha- nisms of effectiveness, to inform the development of future therapeutic techniques
This can reduce mental illness by addressing the prevalent, high impact barriers to effective care–increasing collective capacity for collaboration, supporting individuals who end cycles of abuse, and protecting future generations.



\subsubsection{Warning signs of psychosis and mania}
Psychedelic-induced psychosis and mania are rare unless you have a personal or family history. However, if you or someone you know is showing these signs, we suggest helping them access psychiatric care: \todo{finish} Fear of going insane is not itself a symptom of psychosis or mania. 


However, we also feel these kinds or prompts are among the most fruitful tactics for accessing schemas that would be beneficial to reconsolidate.



 \footnote{The neuroplasticity that psychedelics increase is more accurately described as a reopening of neurodevelopmental windows (called critical periods) where certain types of learning are easier. These critical periods are domain specific, so reopening a reconsolidation critical period is not useful for say, language acquisition, and vice-vera. Luckily, psychedelics actually increase metaplasticity, the general ability to reopen any critical period. The context or activity done during the psychedelic session determines which critical period is reopened. This means doing reconsolidation during the session makes reconsolidation easier in the reopened critical period after the session. It also implies that, for example, spending your session learning another language would induce a language-acquisition critical period.}

 We also suggest reading about the Hard Problem of Consciousness from \textcite{hardProblem}. The linked article at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy outlines a variety of theories of consciousness and the challenges each faces.




 The common phrase "MDMA-therapy give you what you need, not what you want" contains significant truth, even if "need to" is seriously under-defined.
 
 
 
 SSRIs have small average effects (or possibly, higher effect sizes for some poorly understood subtypes of depression, and no effect size for other subtypes) in short term use (long term use is poorly studied) while sometimes causing long-term adverse side effects \cite{ciprianiSSRI,bregginWithdrawal}. Long term benzodiazepine use for anxiety has low efficacy and severe side effects such as long term mental impairment that persists after discontinuation \cite{shinfukuBenzo,barkerBenzo}. \todo{Discuss nuances and variety of treatment options? I feel confident that reconsolidation works. How do mental health interventions work? Is exercise effective by itself or is it just an example of a task that requires effort and feels rewarding? We should talk about the fundamental causes if possible. For instance, if the fundamental mechanism of some intervention is just having a task that feels rewarding, then how do we know it will add any benefit on top of MDMA-therapy, which might already feel rewarding?} \todo{why is reconsolidation better than smushing down feelings?}
 
 

You will likely notice activating remnants of the schemas you reconsolidated during the session. These remnants are easier to deal with than the entire network, perhaps because they are smaller or because you now better understand how that particular emotion affected you. Due to the healing that happened on the session, a variety of mechanisms will also surface different maladaptive schemas.




 Studies of other drugs affecting VHD via the same mechanism suggest there is a linear relationship between cumulative doses and VHD risk \cite{corvol2007heart}. Therefore, we think this risk is low for typical use patterns. Assuming the relationship is linear, extrapolating from \textcite{droogmans2007valvular} indicates that 41 cumulative tablets of MDMA will cause a 1\% risk of abnormal signs on an echocardiogram test. We consider this estimate to be low-quality and, even if it was reliable, we are unclear what practical implications this would have for users.
 
 
 
     Combining MDMA with some drugs of abuse may increase the risk of adverse effects, though high quality data is lacking \cite{papaseitInteractions}. There are strong suspicions that the negative long-term effects seen in some MDMA users are actually due to other drugs of abuse, or mixing other drugs of abuse with MDMA \cite{halpernMormonRavers,passieHistory}. The following drugs are correlated with adverse outcomes when combined with MDMA in recreational contexts, though cause and effect remain highly unclear: opioids, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, stimulants, anesthetics, MDMA metabolites or analogs, muscle relaxants, olanzapine, and metoclopramide \cite{cohenMDMADrugCombinations}. If you regularly use any of these drugs, we suggest following the recommendations in the previous paragraph.
     
     
        \item Pursuing the suggestions from \textcite{adayMethodologicalRigor} and \textcite{vanElkMethodology} for designing more rigorous MDMA-therapy trials. Of particular note is blinding, with most participants accurately deducing whether they got MDMA or placebo. Expectancy effects were also high and may have heightened the problems from lack of adequate blinding.
            \item Does R-MDMA increase the benefit/risk ratio in humans, as a rodent study has suggested \cite{curry2018RMDMA}?
    \item What is an optimal mg/kg dosing? What is the safe upper mg/kg limit? What is the minimal effective mg/kg limit?
\item Also gain a better understanding of the frequency of serious adverse effects. The Swiss Psychedelic Side Effects Inventory look promising \cite{caldervalidation}.





There may be multiple mechanisms of action of psycholytic therapy, and these mechanisms' therapeutic relevance has yet to be fully fleshed-out. One mechanism may include psychedelics bringing the contents of your subconscious into conscious awareness by increasing connectivity between typically less-connected brain regions \cite{linguiti2023functional}, generating insight into your issues \cite{letheby2021philosophy}. Psychedelics also increase neural plasticity, making it easier to see things from a different angle or getting out of ruts \cite{nardou2023psychedelics}. 



MDMA primarily creates feelings of safety, love, and connectedness. In this state your resistance schemas naturally relax and allow processing of avoided or dissociated schemas. MDMA-therapy proceeds similarly for most types of trauma, with minor variations to accommodate individual needs \cite{otaloraMDMA}.


Many physical health problems are symptoms of maladaptive schemas, stress, and defense-cascade activation \cite{kozlowskaDefenseCascade,eckerUnlocking}. Among these problems, some are reversible and will disappear when the underlying schema is reconsolidated, like most of the immediate symptoms of hyperarousal and dissociation (See this list from \textcite{cheetahSigns}). Some heath conditions triggered or exacerbated by maladaptive schemas, stress, and defense-cascade activation may not be reversible or may only be partially reversible. \todo{day write}




We think the 2024 generation of frontier models, Claude 3.5 Sonnet or ChatGPT 4o for instance, may be first generation to be broadly useful. However, their usefulness is likely not applicable to every client's particular needs, and they may represent generally low-quality therapy \cite{wang2025evaluating}. If the 2024 models are not working well for your situation we strongly recommend trying again when a new generation of models is released, since LLM's have been demonstrating major yearly gains in functionality in the early 2020's.



We think LSD and psilocybin are potent tools for reducing resistance. \todo{cite} Mixing LSD or psilocybin with MDMA is widely practiced, though poorly studied \cite{zeifmanCo-use}. We suggest starting with very low doses because LSD or psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy are known for deeply challenging experiences. Adding up to 0.5 g dried psilocybe mushrooms at the beginning of the MDMA session reliably decreases resistance. It also increases the intensity and discomfort of the session. Do not take more than 0.5 g unless you are deeply familiar with the combination. See Section \ref{psychedelics} for more information. This combination is common practice in MDMA-therapy, but no studies have been done \cite{colemanPsychedelicPsychotherapy}. Acutely safe co-use is known from recreational contexts \cite{zeifmanCo-use}.



Extreme threats such as lack of attunement from parents, may cause extreme dissociation from bodily sensations, emotional memories, and current feelings, even while the person appears to be functioning and conversing normally. Chronic dissociation is association with trauma in situations of powerlessness \cite{loewensteinDissociation}. \todo{resolve whether fight or flight is deactivated during dissociation; explain how fight or flight can coexist with dissociation}


Recurrent activation of these states contributes to conditions such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, and dissociative disorders \cite{razviPSIP}. PTSD sufferers, for instance, might frequently switch between heightened aroused and dissociative states. Dissociative and panic states can also simultaneously coexist in many cases of depression and anxiety. We suggest understanding the defense cascade enables safer and more effective healing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Awareness and Insight} Recognizing where you might be within the defense cascade can clarify your reactions and behaviors.
    \item \textbf{Self-Regulation} With awareness, employ techniques like deep breathing or mindfulness to transition from heightened arousal to a calmer state.
    \item \textbf{Pacing} Observing your shifts between hyper-arousal (fight/flight) and hypo-arousal (freeze/collapse) can inform the rhythm of therapy, indicating when to proceed or pause. \todo{not quite right}
    \item \textbf{Empathy Towards Self} Acknowledge these reactions as once protective, fostering self-understanding and compassion.
    \item \textbf{Creating a Safe Environment} Prioritize crafting a secure physical and emotional space, potentially setting boundaries in scenarios prone to activating stimuli.
\end{itemize}


 A common cause of mental illness are protective responses to threats experienced during childhood that are originally adaptive, but then stick around into adulthood where they are no longer needed or healthy.




Our minds continually create and update a network of unconscious memory structures called schemas \cite{eckerUnlocking}. Schemas are composed of detailed memories, abstract beliefs, and emotional responses. They form in response to emotionally positive or negative experiences to help guide our behavior when we encounter similar situations in the future. \todo{finish}





This emotional response and the associated episodic memory (a narrative of how events unfolded during a specific event or "episode") then form and combine with abstract beliefs about the world to form durable, unconscious or partly unconscious structures called schemas, or 'parts' (from the Internal Family Systems framework) \cite{laneReconsolidation,lesswrongCoherenceTherapy}. The emotional, episodic, and belief components interact with each other and activating one activates the others. Schemas are originally protective or adaptive (enhances your ability to cope with your environment; see Figure \ref{fig:adaptiveSchema}), but sometimes become maladaptive (inhibits your ability to cope with your environment; see Figure \ref{fig:maladaptiveSchema1}) when they don't adapt to changing conditions due to the above reasons.

*Schemas are stored as networks of neural connections spread across brain regions \cite{eckerUnlocking}. Some networks are complex, composed of multiple traumatic events and activated by a wide variety of stimuli. The stimuli may be singular and obvious like seeing a wasp of the same kind that once stung you, or diffuse and difficult to understand like a mood, thought, or time of day. We are often unaware of our activating stimuli.



In addition to possibly lacking an episodic component, schemas may contain and sustain other signals in the brain, such as chronic pain or feelings in your chest or abdomen. The mind may interpret particularly strong collections of schemas as separate personalities.



Children are easily traumatized because they have very little ability to protect themselves. A wide variety of situations that are not overwhelming to healthy adults are life-threats to children.

We think a track record of successful treatment is also vital. Repeated unproductive attempts at MDMA-therapy, or even a single exceptionally distressing session, may push someone to unfairly discount the possibility that MDMA-therapy can be effective. This guide aims to put distressing sessions into a larger context where the distress or adverse outcome might be an okay part of a long-term healing process, an unnecessary outcome that can be avoided with proper technique, or sign that MDMA isn't the right tool. Another goal is providing best-practices, risk-factors, and troubleshooting information to reduce the likelihood of unproductive sessions.



Unlike most therapeutic modalities, going beyond the therapeutic window into a panic response is rarely a barrier to reconsolidation during an MDMA session. MDMA is also effective at reducing dissociation, however when the dissociation is strong enough it can still be a barrier. It typically presents as sleepiness, feeling bored or sober, or feeling disconnected from emotions. When dissociation impedes the therapeutic process, practicing extended focus meditation toward the dissociation often resolves the issue. A different approach such as Psychedelic Somatic Interactional Psychotherapy (PSIP) may be needed first if dissociation is so intense that the client falls asleep. Resistance or avoidance may also still be present during an MDMA-therapy session and can be worked with by worked with through both standard and novel therapeutic practices. These may include asking the client to practice selective inhibition (see Section \ref{selectiveInhibition}), prompting the client to focus on and stay present with their emotions instead of thinking or ruminating, or asking probing questions about feelings, beliefs, and the events that may have created them.

This reduces dissociation and resistance, and provides a strong mismatch for reconsolidating maladaptive schemas. We based this manual on the schema/reconsolidation framework because of its epistemological foundation in lower-level neuroscience models and our belief that it is a major component of almost all therapeutic change. Schemas are memory structures containing multiple integrated and co-activating components: emotional responses (e.g. fear at the sight of dogs), abstract beliefs (e.g. dogs are dangerous), and episodic memories (e.g. being bitten by a dog as a young child). Minds create schemas to guide us toward beneficial actions and away from harmful ones. Schemas change over time as situations change, or as we grow up and acquire increased capability to cope with challenges. A schema reconsolidates (updates) when relevant stimuli activate it, and your brain detects a mismatch between the emotional responses or beliefs of the activated schema and the current situation (or a second activated schema, as is often used in therapy). Schemas can become maladaptive when prevented from updating by avoidance, resistance, lack of resources, fight-or-flight, or dissociation. They are similar to the parts of Internal Family Systems. In therapy, mismatches are often constructed and held in focus for a duration of time to deliberately rewrite and re-store the schema in a new, durable, and adaptive form. The safety and connection of MDMA create a strong, possibly universal, mismatch that easily reconsolidates most maladaptive schemas.

\item This is usually simple–"sitting on the couch after finding out my friends are throwing a party without me", "Just found out election results", "hiding in my office after gnarly performance review," etc.
\item When there's time I like to be exhaustive with this column, because people are more open to their most compassionate and flexible selves when they feel deeply seen and known. One way to approach this is to start with the self-attunement tool I've adapted from Bren{\'e} Brown, then sort, copy, and paste.
\item As with every column, if a different scale (or a variant of what the column is asking) works better for you, go with that.
\item All the ruminations in the rumination cycle go here. Some good prompt questions are: what does it feel like this situation is saying about your identity or your future? When we select and bold the hot thought from this list–for the most effective thought record, we are looking for the thought that is most avoided, most painful, most dreaded.  We're looking for a kind of "third rail" quality. We're looking for the thought that would be most relieving to learn isn't as true as you thought it was.
\item I like to make this column exhaustive so that people have the experience of casting about for more evidence–preferably repeatedly–and not being able to find it. If you aren't exhaustive with this one, your brain will sometimes think there is more evidence you've left off the list than there actually is, and that helps it dig in.
\item This column does not need to be exhaustive (in fact, better to quit before you quite hit that sense of exhaustion) but you need some. I like the prompt, "are there any ways in which the hot thought is not 100\% true 100\% of the time?"
\item Summarize evidence for, summarize evidence against, combine with a conjunction (and, but, however). Most effective in the own words of the person whose thoughts are being recorded. :)
\item The point of this exercise is not to change feelings, but recording the before and after like this helps people register more strongly the experience of "good things happening by facing the difficult emotions," which builds resilience–especially if repeated over time

For people who experience alexithymia or who would like support in identifying their own emotions, we recommend this self-attunement tool. It consists of a list of emotions (each of which is elaborated on in Bren{\'e} Brown's Atlas of the Heart) and an instruction to rate how strongly one is feeling each of them \cite{brown2021atlas}. It can be helpful to complete this in a spreadsheet and then sort the responses by the number assigned to then intensity with which one is feeling each emotion–which can also be copied and pasted into columns 2 and 3 of the thought record.

Psychedelic-assisted-therapy trials frequently suffer from methodological problems such as especially poor blinding and high researcher bias \cite{adayMethodologicalRigor}. Because the phase 3 trial participants (and their therapists) usually deduced whether or not they had been given MDMA or placebo, the trials were effectively only partially blinded. While this is a major limitation of these types of studies, we don't think it totally disqualifies them as useful sources of evidence. Psychedelic blinding is inherently difficult to account for because of its strong mental effects. Additionally, some trial participants reported intense expectations of good results \cite{powerTrip}. This expectancy effect likely exacerbates the consequences of poor blinding. We suggest \textcite{vanElkMethodology} for a thorough discussion of these problems. We note that placebo treatments can still be useful if the placebo-induced safety and compassion are strong enough to achieve memory reconsolidation. We also suspect MDMA-therapy is more effective than placebo due to its close alignment with the memory reconsolidation mechanism of action. There are also numerous anecdotal reports of inadvertent profound and durable therapeutic improvement in situations where the user was intending a recreational, rather than therapeutic experience.

MDMA may also slightly change recollection of episodic details of emotionally charged memories \cite{dossRecollection}. 

The complexities of forgotten and remembered memories of abuse are strongly debated within psychology, but there are some general guidelines: While the emotional tone of a memory is a reliable indicator of your subjective experience, episodic memory is flexible and amenable to change over time \cite{reynaFuzzyTrace}. The episodic gist (the overarching theme of a remembered event) is also significantly more reliable than episodic details. Trauma can further impair episodic memory formation, sometimes leading to missing or fragmented memories of traumatic events \cite{vanderKolkBody} \todo{really?}. Time passed since the event and the number of times you have recalled the memory also decrease reliability \cite{laneReconsolidation}. Use extra caution with psychedelics, as they can increase mental imagery and feelings of significance \cite{griffithsSignificance,araujoImagery}. Seek independent corroboration of recovered memories if possible. Due to the power of suggestion, therapists and guides should avoid leading questions, suggestive techniques, and undue influence that might inadvertently plant or reinforce unfounded memories of childhood abuse. 

Based on the memory reconsolidation model, we think MDMA-therapy can potentially treat any mental illnesses that in significant-part consists maladaptive schemas and consequent defense-cascade activation \cite{carhart2019rebus,eckerUnlocking}. \textcite{coherenceSymptoms} has a list of symptoms they have found treatable with memory reconsolidation practices. While we think they are reputable, take the list with a grain of salt because it mostly consists of case studies involving single examples. We think most emotional problems and unhelpful reactivity that don't rise to the level of mental-illness are also schema-based. ADHD is a heterogeneous collection of symptoms with multiple causes, not a single well-defined disorder \cite{luoADHDcauses}. Because of this, it is difficult to say whether some subtypes of ADHD might be schema-based and amenable to treatment with MDMA-therapy. The symptoms of certain types of attachment disorders (which are schema-based) also overlap with ADHD symptoms, making the two difficult to distinguish \cite{follan2011discrimination}. Therefore, we suggest MDMA-therapy may be worth trying for those with ADHD, given the possibility of misdiagnosis or a schema-based subtype of ADHD. MDMA-therapy cannot cure autism, which is genetically- and environmentally-determined, but it can treat the anxieties that autistic people often have \cite{taylorAutismEtiology,danforth2018autismMDMA}. MDMA-therapy is effective for durably improving alexithymia and reconsolidating maladaptive schemas in the presence of strong alexithymia, which is often a barrier to reconsolidation \cite{vanSelfExperience}.

Many mental illness have some degree of genetic susceptibility \cite{plomin2016top}. For, instance, psychosis and mania have strong genetic links, but episodes are often triggered or exacerbated by stress \cite{winkelPsychosisStress,Umeoka2021stressmania}. MDMA-therapy cannot change genetic susceptibility, but we think it could resolve schema-based stress exacerbation of strongly genetic mental illnesses.

It is not entirely known which mental illnesses are schema-based or can be addressed by MDMA-therapy. We suspect a large majority have significant schema-based components. MDMA therapy has specifically show preliminary effectiveness for PTSD, dissociation, depression, and functional impairment \cite{greenMeta}. It has also shown preliminary improvement in well-being, excess vigilance, nightmares, avoidance, anxiety, and sleep in those with PTSD \cite{smithSystematic}.

Reconsolidation produces significant, worthwhile, and continuous improvements in particular schemas (and their associated symptoms).

You may experience feelings of intense and spontaneous compassion, connectedness, or love. We speculate these are flashbacks to the MDMA session and will gradually dissipate as the memory is reconsolidated. These increases in compassion almost always have good consequences for you and those around you.


Self-assessment of the severity of your problems is useful for this last item. This is difficult since we are often not explicitly aware of our schemas, but there are some methods. If we had to choose one scale we

\section{Loving-Kindness Meditation for Dissociation}
\label{lkmeditation}
Loving-kindness meditation can be directed towards one's dissociative experiences, fostering compassion and understanding for parts of oneself that disconnect under stress. This compassionate focus helps integrate these dissociative parts, building internal coherence and reducing self-judgment. If you find any of these instructions don't work for you, feel free to modify them in a way that works better. \todo{do this on medicine if youre dissociating}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Find a Quiet Place} Choose a location where you won't be disturbed for around 15-20 minutes. This could be a quiet room, a peaceful outdoor location, or even a calm corner of your house.
    \item \textbf{Choose a Comfortable Position} You can sit cross-legged on the floor, on a cushion, in a chair, or even lay down. Ensure your back is straight or well-supported, you can breath comfortably, and your hands can rest comfortably on your lap or by your side.
    \item \textbf{Close Your Eyes} Shut your eyes gently to minimize external distractions and help you focus inwards.
    \item \textbf{Focus on Your Breath} Take a few deep breaths. Inhale deeply through your nose and exhale through your mouth. This calms the mind and prepares you for the meditation.
    \item \textbf{Recognizing Dissociation} Begin by reflecting on moments when you felt disconnected from your surroundings, your body, or your emotions. Understand that dissociation served as a way for your mind to protect itself from overwhelming situations or feelings.
    \item \textbf{Gratitude for its Service} With each inhaled breath, feel gratitude for this dissociative mechanism. It stepped in during moments of intense distress, attempting to keep you safe by creating distance from the pain. With each exhale, silently express gratitude, thinking “thank you” for its protective intentions.
    \item \textbf{Compassionate Inquiry} As you breathe, gently ask your dissociative part, "What were you shielding me from?" Allow any memories, feelings, or sensations to emerge, welcoming them without judgment.
    \item \textbf{Reassuring the Dissociative Part} Offer words of comfort and acknowledgement. You might internally convey messages like, "I understand why you were there," "I'm safe now," or "You can rest."
    \item \textbf{Visualization} Imagine the dissociative part of you as a gentle veil or mist. With gratitude and understanding, visualize this veil lifting, connecting you back to the present moment and your surroundings.
    \item \textbf{Reconsolidation} If difficult feelings come up, even frustration or disappointment, stay present with them until they reconsolidate.
\end{enumerate}

It's normal to get distracted during the meditation. Whenever you notice your mind wandering, gently bring your focus back to the phrases.

A similar practice can be done in daily life for items other than dissociation. Start with loving-kindness toward yourself, then expand to loved ones, neutral people, difficult people, and finally all beings. Imagine them sitting in front of you and direct this set of phrases toward them: "May you be happy" "May you be safe" "May you be healthy" "May you live with ease." Over time, aim to practice loving-kindness daily or as often as you can to cultivate a heart full of compassion. Remember, the goal of Loving Kindness Meditation is not to achieve a particular state but to cultivate an attitude of goodwill and compassion. The more you practice, the more natural these feelings will become in your daily life. See \textit{Lovingkindness, The Revolutionary Art of Happiness} by Sharon Salzberg for a thorough exploration of the practice \cite{salzbergLovingKindness}. \todo{link to external guide for compassion meditation}



\section{Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction}
\label{MBSR}
This is an introduction to Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) specifically tailored for individuals coping with distressing emotions and reactions, often associated with trauma. By introducing the foundational principles of mindfulness and offering a series of methodical practices—from body awareness exercises to cultivating self-compassion—it nurtures a heightened sense of presence, self-awareness, and emotional regulation. Through these exercises, individuals can develop skills to ground themselves during overwhelming moments, redirect wandering thoughts, and approach distressing feelings with a compassionate lens. MBSR is effective for coping with a wide variety of mental health conditions including stress, trauma, depression, and anxiety \cite{liuMBSR,khouryMBSR}. The body scan meditation part of MBSR may also help you locate schema-specific muscle tenseness. \todo{check that this list accurately represents MBSR}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Understanding Mindfulness} Mindfulness involves deliberately paying attention, non-judgmentally, in the present moment. This approach helps distance oneself from automatic reactions and habitual patterns, often shaped by past traumatic events. \todo{check john kabat plagarization; cite}
    \item \textbf{Body Scan Meditation} Lie down in a comfortable position. Gradually move your attention through different parts of your body, from your toes to your head. Notice sensations without trying to change them. If the attention wanders, non-judgmentally gently bring it back. Go at your own pace.
    \item \textbf{Mindful Breathing} Focus attention on the breath, noticing the sensations of breathing in and out. When the mind wanders, gently return your attention to the breath. If focusing on the breath activates overwhelming schemas, shift attention to another anchor, like the soles of the feet or sounds in the environment.
    \item \textbf{Gentle Yoga and Stretching} Incorporate gentle movements to connect with the body. Always listen to your body and only do what feels comfortable. Remember, it's not about performance but about feeling and connecting with your body.
    \item \textbf{Sitting Meditation} Sit comfortably, with a straight or well-supported back, and make sure you can breath comfortably. Pay attention to the sensations of the breath, or choose another anchor. Notice thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them. If strong emotions or memories arise, ground yourself by feeling your feet on the ground or opening your eyes and focusing on your surroundings.
    \item \textbf{Walking Meditation} Walk slowly and deliberately, being mindful of each step and the sensation of movement and touch. This can be grounding for trauma survivors, as it emphasizes the connection between the body and the earth.
    \item \textbf{Cultivate Self-Compassion} Send wishes of well-being to oneself and others. This helps in healing emotional wounds and replacing negative thought patterns rooted in trauma. \todo{link to compassion meditation instructions}
    \item \textbf{Mindful Everyday Activities} Practice being fully present during routine activities like eating, showering, or driving. This strengthens the habit of mindfulness, making it easier to summon during challenging moments.
    \item \textbf{Group Sharing} Sharing experiences with trusted others can offer validation and support, but ensure it's a safe and understanding environment.
    \item \textbf{Daily Practice} Establishing a routine, even if it's just for a few minutes, helps solidify the skills and reinforces the benefits.

Meditation can produce a wide variety of pleasant, distressing, or strange effects. Some are no more than curiosities, others provide insight into the workings of the mind, and yet others can be harmful. Different contemplative traditions also attach different lessons to these effects or may suggest different paths of meditation to follow or avoid. \textcite{cheetahHouse} provides a non-denominational service for helping meditators understand their difficult meditative experiences and adapt those practices to your needs. We also highly recommend \textcite{treleaven2018trauma}.


    \item \textcite{bailey2023defense} provides an overview of psychological defense mechanisms, a concept from the psychoanalytic branch of psychotherapy. We are skeptical of the evidentiary foundation of psychoanalysis. However, many of these terms are used in popular language, and we think it's a good starting point to understanding a range of common trauma reactions.


    \item[\textbf{Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)}] \textcite{waxenbaum2019ANS} define the ANS as "...component of the peripheral nervous system [as opposed to the central nervous system - the brain] that regulates involuntary physiologic processes including heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, digestion, and sexual arousal."
        \item[\textbf{Abstract Belief}] The schema component that contains abstract understandings of the world. Someone with dog-related trauma may have the abstract belief "dogs are dangerous."
    \item[\textbf{Emotional Response}] The aspect of a schema that captures and retains the emotional charge or significance associated with an event, allowing emotions experienced during the event to be re-experienced when the memory is recalled. To facilitate reconsolidation, the emotional response is juxtaposed with a contradictory emotion.
    \item[\textbf{Episodic Memory}] The aspect of a schema that involves the recollection of a specific event, situation, and experience, including their temporal and spatial contexts. Together with an abstract memory and emotional response, this comprises a schema. Episodic memories can provide a lens with which to focus on specific schemas for reconsolidation.
    \item[\textbf{Therapeutic window}] The zone where you can activate and stay present with maladaptive schemas without being overwhelmed by anxiety or disconnected by dissociation.
\todo{Do we need a glossary when everything is defined within the first 6 pages of chapter 2? People can just go look there.}
\begin{description}
    \item[\textbf{Contraindication}] A specific situation or condition in which a particular treatment, procedure, or drug may not be appropriate in a particular case because it may be especially harmful.
    \item[\textbf{Therapeutic Destabilization}] A state where an individual experiences increased emotional, psychological, or physiological distress, often as a result of confronting or processing traumatic memories or experiences. This can lead to heightened symptoms or new symptoms and requires careful management to ensure the individual's well-being.
    \item[\textbf{Defense Cascade}] This part of the autonomic nervous system initiates a sequential set of physiological and behavioral responses in response to perceived threat or danger. It typically progresses from an initial "alert" response, to more extreme reactions like "fight or flight", "freeze,", or "dissociation," depending on the level and duration of the threat.
    \item[\textbf{Disconfirming Experience}] An experience that undermines and refutes the validity of maladaptive schemas. Disconfirming experiences can accelerate the reconsolidation of maladaptive schemas.
    \item[\textbf{Dissociation}] A disconnection and lack of continuity between thoughts, memories, surroundings, actions, and identity. It's part of the defense cascade that can become activated in situations of threat and powerlessness.
    \item[\textbf{Reconsolidation}] Memory reconsolidation is the neurological process in which a schema (a type of memory) is recalled, modified, then re-stored. The modification starts when there is a mismatch between the schema's prediction ("broccoli is bad") and your current experience ("this broccoli is good!").
    \item[\textbf{Resistance}] A person's actions that inhibit reconsolidation. These may include conscious or unconscious avoidance schemas like drinking alcohol when distressed, escapist habits, addictions, believing "feeling emotions is weakness", declining to connect with or trust supports that are trustworthy and appropriate, fear that healing a schema will hurt you in some way, denial, projection, rationalization, etc.
    \item[\textbf{Suppression}] The conscious effort to control and avoid unwanted thoughts or feelings. This can be healthy and adaptive when used for short periods to maintain practical capacities until facing those feelings is appropriate.
    \item[\textbf{Trauma}] An event or series of events that overwhelms an individual's capacity to cope, often leaving maladaptive schemas and maladaptive coping mechanisms in its wake.
    \item[\textbf{Trauma Therapy}] A specialized, structured process designed to address the emotional, cognitive, and physiological residues of traumatic experiences, helping individuals process distressing memories, reduce trauma-related symptoms, and improve overall functioning.

	\item MDMA-therapy induces a period of post-session neuroplasticity that makes memory reconsolidation easier or more powerful (\textcite{nardouMDMAPlasticity}). Certainty - medium. This relies on a small set of studies by one lab group on mice and extrapolating the applicability of neuroplasticity from one context to another, but matches up with personal experience and some personal reports from other people.

\textcite{nardouMDMAPlasticity} has showed that MDMA increases the capacity for certain types of learning and neuroplasticity, possibly making therapy is easier and more effective \footnote{They only investigated social reward learning in rodents, but we have observed that people commonly report a similarly few-week long period after MDMA-therapy where therapy seems easier, and they feel less mentally ill. We think it's a reasonable extrapolation that MDMA-induced neuroplasticity makes this few-week long period especially useful for additional therapy.}. We are unclear on the extent to which these two conceptions describe the same phenomena, but both describe similar ways in which MDMA could facilitate general reconsolidation. 


    \item Additional reconsolidation may be easier in the few-weeks-long neuroplastic period after the session \cite{nardouMDMAPlasticity}, so we recommend planning to do as much as possible in this window.

Because of that, we suspect that this period of feeling good is what increased neuroplasticity feels like in your particular context. Neuroplasticity likely aids out-of-session reconsolidation. However, while can also feel good in itself, it is a transient phenomena.

**MDMA induces a period (2-4 weeks in mice) of certain types of neuroplasticity \cite{nardouMDMAPlasticity}. We have experienced that between-session reconsolidation exercises are easier during this period. If you want to accelerate healing, we recommend spending more effort on and experimenting with reconsolidation exercises in this period rather than more frequent MDMA use. You may even find that maxing-out your reconsolidation capacity every day will deliver very large amounts of therapeutic progress. Developing the skill of sober reconsolidation can reduce your therapeutic reliance on MDMA and allow reconsolidation in a wide variety of circumstances where MDMA use is not appropriate. When well-developed it also allows faster healing because the safety and logistical considerations of MDMA-therapy are no longer limiting. In the absence of better safety data, waiting to do another session until after the neuroplastic period also increases the margin of safety vs only waiting a few days until you are no longer fatigued.

MDMA induces a period (2-4 weeks in mice) of certain types of neuroplasticity (your brain's ability to adapt) \cite{nardouMDMAPlasticity}. We posit that the neuroplasticity window after an MDMA treatment may offer an extra boost of support in making changes you seek in your life. This period may be context dependent. That is, a therapeutic session may lead to therapy-relevant neuroplasticity, but a recreational session might not. Some people may find that as they reconsolidate schemas and have positive disconfirming experiences, they have less need for compulsive self-soothing over time. They benefit from the therapy not just through reconsolidation, but through the support that the subsequent peace and perspective provide for positive behavioral changes. Sometimes being in a rut is the function of inertia; sometimes it is self protective, and improved regulation or a sense of new experience or perspective can help a person break out of it.



 (mean of 3.6 tablets every week for 6.1 years) However, this is far more MDMA than is used for therapy.

 Additionally, reported effect sizes in psychiatric drug effect sizes have declined over time, possibly due to early trials tending to be of poor quality, publication bias, or changes in the characteristics of people seeking treatment \cite{leuchtDecline}. If the second explanation is correct, then the average person trying MDMA-therapy in 2050 may have significantly less success than the average person in 2025.

 As \textcite{eckerUnlocking} state, "The therapist's stance is one of cooperating with and trusting the client's inherent capability of revising emotional learnings."

 \textbf{What an ethical, skilled, and well-matched therapist or guide can provide}
\noindent \textbf{What degree of professional support is right for you?}



	\item \textbf{Internal Family Systems (IFS):} We have observed many people report IFS working well with MDMA therapy. We also recommend it because it closely aligns with the memory reconsolidation framework \cite{eckerUnlocking}. However, we think you should know that some IFS practitioners believe some mental problems, specifically "unattached burdens" in IFS terminology, are caused by objectively-real malevolent spirits \cite{IFSdemons}.

It treats all problematic or distressing habits, emotional responses, and beliefs as logically consistent with the individual's internal emotional landscape. These maladaptive schemas are deliberately juxtaposed with a contradictory experience from the individual's past to update the individual's emotional landscape to better fit their current context. 

	\item \textbf{Psychedelic Somatic Interactional Psychotherapy (PSIP):} Though rigorous trials have not yet been done, we think this method shows particular promise for reducing panic or dissociation that impede typical therapeutic methods \cite{razviPSIP,ragnhildstveit2023cannabis}. In this method, a small dose of THC or ketamine is used to directly engage with, and process, the hyper or hypo-activated defense cascade. We recommend a paper by \textcite{razviPSIP} and a presentation by \textcite{razviPresentation} for an introduction to the topic. A directory of trained PSIP therapists is maintained by \textcite{psipDirectory}. We recommend it mostly based on popularity of the method in psychedelic therapy, personal experience, and its alignment with the defense cascade.

The previous section on compassion meditation may also be useful here. Tribalism often involves "othering" rival groups that involves discounting their worth. How does it feel to consider that they have just as much intrinsic worth, and fundamentally deserve just as much compassion as your members of group? How does the MDMA shift that discomfort over time?

**If you're a fan of skeptical inquiry, MDMA's safety could very well help you "...think the thought that hurts the most [e.g. What if the other side is right? What if my political/religious/other belief is wrong?] \cite{eliezerCrisis}."


% \chapter{The Expanded Self}
% Some frameworks of psychedelic integration, including those of many indigenous cultures, consider community, interpersonal relationships, the natural world, and existential insights to be essential components of healing process \cite{bathje2022Integration}. \textcite{celidwen2023Indigenous} reports the following as broadly agreed-upon by traditional indigenous practitioners of psychedelic medicine:
% \begin{quotation}
%     Traditional Indigenous medicine is an ethical, ecosystem-protective, and holistic system of medicine that interconnects humans and the environment. A sense of reverence for the planet guides all relationships, as well as a commitment to preserve all life. Traditional Indigenous medicine from a systems and relational perspective prompts insight for compassionate living and awareness of collective care to sustain the wellbeing of the medicines themselves as well as all future generations.
% \end{quotation}
% In these models, these other components may not be described as fundamentally different than what is commonly meant by the self in the Western world. They may actually be described as different aspects of an expanded self. In practice, this might look something like this: During an MDMA-therapy session you experienced compassionate insight into the causes of a maladaptive or harmful behavioral pattern of yours. You sat with the pain of the behavior-causing schema and it dissipated. This experience helped you understand the causes of your behavior and the solution to ending that pattern. In an extended-self model this insight would also be applied to other domains of life. What implications does knowledge of maladaptive schemas have for public policy, the criminal justice system, cultural practices in your community, etc? Another example: During a session you had a deep understanding that you are worth of love and care; your wellbeing is deeply important, no matter what. This understanding persisted into daily life and you feel an ongoing sense of self-worth that you were previously missing. In the expanded-self model this insight would be transferred to others. The wellbeing of all beings is deeply important, including people who have hurt you, animals, and possibly even insects. What does this mean for how you treat them and how the systems you are a part of treat them?

% We present here a few sections that we think are particularly relevant for the expanded-self in a modern world.


% Unconscious avoidance and resistance are powerful obstacles to healing. Incorporating small amounts of psilocybin or LSD into your session can help bring avoided feelings into focus (see Section \ref{sec:dissociationandresistance}). \todo{do they really? revisit polydrug use}


%\section{Psycholytic Therapy}
%\label{psychedelics}
%Small to medium-dose LSD (30-150 $\mu$g, lasting ~10 hours) or psilocybin (3-15 mg, lasting ~5 hours) sessions have a long history of therapeutic use \cite{passiePsycholytic}. This use of psychedelics is differentiated from traditional North American approaches by its lower doses. At these low doses the primary contraindications are pregnancy, serious liver and kidney diseases, some types of brain disorders, or personal or family history of psychosis or bipolar disorder/mania \cite{schlagPsychedelicAdverseEffects,passiePsycholytic}. We also suggest that a history of suicidal ideation indicates support (making a plan with a therapist or guide, using an experienced sitter, and spending time with trusted friends or family) during and after the session. Higher doses increase the risk of overwhelming engagement with distressing emotions. LSD and psilocybin possess anti-addictive properties and are not euphoric enough to pose a risk of psychological addiction \cite{principeAddiction}.
%
%We strongly recommend starting at the lowest end (or lower) of this dose range and only slowly increasing dose session-to-session if you feel like you could benefit from a higher dose. The MDMA session-preparation guidelines discussed earlier are generally applicable to psycholytic therapy as well.
%
%We especially recommend avoiding frequent, high doses of hallucinatory psychedelics. That, along with large amounts of certain types of high-level meditation, sometimes lead to extended psychosis, mania, or other maladaptive states, possibly even in mentally healthy people \cite{ingram2018mastering}.
%
%A wide variety of strange and profound feelings and thoughts are a common effects of psychedelics \cite{yaden2022varieties}. However, people typically interpret these experiences through the lens of their existing belief systems, belief systems they are aware of, and even symbols present in the session environment. These may include religion, metaphysical theories, or cultural tropes such as "psychedelics show the truth behind all things." While some of these thoughts and feelings may be true of our shared reality, we suggest keeping in mind that people interpret these experiences in a wide variety of different and contradictory ways \cite{notalltrue}. Many psychedelic feelings and thoughts are just hallucinations or representations of your mind. Psychedelics are also known to inflate feelings of meaning and not all insight is an accurate map of reality \cite{hartogsohn2018meaning,tulverInsight}. We suggest deliberation and skepticism before deciding whether your own experience either confirms or disconfirms any particular belief. \textcite{suggestibility} goes into depth about how psychedelics and power imbalances can increase suggestibility and decrease critical thinking.




%We think LSD and psilocybin are potent tools for reducing resistance. \todo{cite} Mixing LSD or psilocybin with MDMA is widely practiced, though poorly studied \cite{zeifmanCo-use}. We suggest starting with very low doses because LSD or psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy are known for deeply challenging experiences. Adding up to 0.5 g dried psilocybe mushrooms at the beginning of the MDMA session reliably decreases resistance. It also increases the intensity and discomfort of the session. Do not take more than 0.5 g unless you are deeply familiar with the combination. See Section \ref{psychedelics} for more information. This combination is common practice in MDMA-therapy, but no studies have been done \cite{colemanPsychedelicPsychotherapy}. Acutely safe co-use is known from recreational contexts \cite{zeifmanCo-use}.



%It is often difficult to access activating schemas. We have noticed that walking, other body-movement practices, selective inhibition (see Section \ref{selectiveInhibition}) or a 2.5-5 $\mu$g LSD supplement (see Section \ref{psychedelics}) can help.



	% \item psycholytic therapy (see Section \ref{psychedelics})



%\section{Thought Record}
%%\label{challengingBeliefsWorksheet}
%Some prefer more cognitive preparation before creating a mismatch for reconsolidation. \todo{day write} This may bring implicit schemas into explicit awareness. Some also like it for structure. One popular method is the thought record in Appendix \ref{thoughtRecord}. Resistance often lead us astray when we think about our emotions and beliefs, adding difficulty to the cognitive preparation approach.


\footnote{The organization cited here and throughout this section, Psymposia, is highly controversial within the field. The NYTimes reported: "Despite Psymposia's modest resources, its members have become feared for their ability to use social media to damage reputations and careers, according to more than four dozen academic researchers, clinicians, industry executives, mental health advocates and former Psymposia members who were interviewed for this article. Many asked not to be named for fear of retaliation."\cite{psymposiaFear}}

    \item When, how much, and why do some psychedelics cause short term (days-weeks) cognitive impairment?



    The complete list of these fundamental sources of error is not known, and is likely somewhat different for each person, at least only in the sense that e.g. for one person hunger might weighted slightly higher than in another person. Even if the fundamental sources of error were roughly the same for everyone, the secondary sources of error derived from our infinitely-complex learned schemas are always different. Outside of temporary fulfillment, error for these things may only be completely zeroed-out in certain extraordinary states of mind. We don't know if MDMA-therapy optimizes your schemas according to your existing optimization function, or an MDMA-modified optimization function that includes different fundamental sources (perhaps different weighting of existing sources of error) of prediction error. These may be slightly different for each person, and the infinitely-complex secondary schemas that create behavior (e.g. how to use your legs to walk to where the food is, how to prepare this specific food, etc.) are always different to some degree. 


 In the clinical trials, 30\% (Our own averaging of the two trials) of the MDMA group and 27\% of the placebo group reported suicidal ideation at the start of the study. After the last data point (integrative session 3 of the third MDMA session) available in both trials, 20\% of the MDMA group and 20\% of the placebo group reported suicidal ideation. Events of suicidal behavior or serious ideation during the trials were reported in 6\% of the MDMA group and 8\% of the placebo group. 


 We suggest not calling or texting anyone until you have more experience with MDMA and you know the other person is comfortable talking to you in your altered state. 


 *Different therapeutic frameworks, preferred by different therapists or guides, provide different ways to access target schemas \cite{eckerUnlocking}. In this section we present a minimum usable framework for readers: activate target schema (one may already be activated at the start of your session); stay present with the distress while the schema reconsolidates; repeat. We also discuss how to deal with dissociation and avoidance. 


 %\section{After the Session}
%\label{after}
%*Physical and emotional exhaustion is common and healthy after therapy and reconsolidation. Because MDMA-therapy is so intense, we suggest planning for 1-2 more days of exhaustion post-session. MDMA can also cause a period of headaches, lack of appetite, lack of energy, dry mouth, difficulty concentrating, and jaw clenching \cite{vizeliActuteEffects}. These symptoms are strongly correlated with dose and usually last up to 3 days \cite{liechtiGender}. We suggest plenty of rest and comforting yourself in ways good for you. Ensure your schedule is clear of major commitments or stressors in the days following. \todo{list of good comforting techniques}
%
%Short-term improvements in your target schema or symptom are not very reliable for those with complex trauma. Longer term progress in overall emotional health is much more assured.
%
%Healing is a complexly layered process. As one layer of emotional distress is calmed, other schemas usually activate and/or become more visible. Though initially challenging, consistent reconsolidation will lead to long-term improvement. This cycle is noticeable both in the long-term (months-years) and short-term (the week after a session may feel more volatile than normal). We suggest not judging a session until 1-2 weeks have passed.
%
%*You will experience more time in the mind's relaxed state when maladaptive schemas/parts heal. The Internal Family Systems framework proposes this relaxed state consists of calmness, clarity, curiosity, compassion, confidence, courage, creativity, connectedness, perspective, joy, patience, kindness, equanimity, playfulness, and love \cite{schwartz2019internal}. Periods of dysfunction will remain, but will become less frequent. If the maladaptive schemas are severe, it might take quite a lot of healing to get to the point where anything feels ok. We suggest staying on top of reconsolidation and defense cascade deactivation, and avoiding situations that activate challenging schemas will help (see Section \ref{sectionManagement}).




**If you know you are near the end of the session, we suggest not diving into any additional schemas, though finishing up reconsolidating your current ones is helpful. Surfacing previously unconscious schemas without adequate time to reconsolidate them could result in that schema dominating your post-session life if it strong enough. On the other hand, diving into additional schemas may be beneficial if you can tolerate the distress and want help making your unconscious schemas explicit for post-session reconsolidation.



 \footnote{Most or all behavior is composed of schemas optimized for future fulfillment of some set of fundamental sources of prediction error.}



 "Protector backlash" from the Internal Family Systems framework may describe a similar phenomena \cite{schwartz2019internal}. 


  \footnote{Some of the major genes involved in mental health may function by making individuals more generally sensitive to their environment such that in environments of adversity they function worse than average and are more susceptible to a variety of mental illnesses, but also function better than average in response to healthy environments and childhoods \cite{assary2018gene}.}


  Additional experiments and are often needed to figure out the intermediate steps. 

  We recommend \textcite{evansBlame} for balanced reporting of why the FDA requested Lykos' do another study before reviewing the MDMA drug application again. 

   \textcite{schenberg2024psychedelic} also discusses how the FDA may have rejected the application because 1) the FDA's process is only capable of evaluating the effect of a drug alone, and can't evaluate the combined drug-therapy intervention 2) the FDA advisory committee didn't have the appropriate expertise to evaluate the application.

   The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review reported issues with blinding, high expectations of good results, and lack of long-term cardiovascular data \cite{icerReport}.

While rigorous and highly promising, these studies were organized by a single organization, and a different methodology may show different results. MDMA-therapy with therapists less familiar with MDMA may also be less effective. 

Those with multiple traumatic events or mental illnesses, as is common in early-life trauma, will need a longer time frame and number of sessions to reconsolidate all the schemas they want to address. 

 How much role genes play in each specific mental illness is not settled, but it does appear to vary significantly \cite{assary2018gene}.


 Here is grab-bag list of information we are aware of for particular disorders (Take these with a grain of salt. None of these trials controlled for blinding or used active placebos.):
\begin{itemize}
	\item ADHD is a heterogeneous collection of symptoms with multiple causes, not a single well-defined disorder \cite{luoADHDcauses}. Because of this, it is difficult to say whether some subtypes of ADHD might be schema-based and amenable to treatment with MDMA-therapy. The symptoms of certain types of attachment disorders (clearly schema-based in our opinion) also overlap with ADHD symptoms, making the two difficult to distinguish \cite{follan2011discrimination}.
	\item MDMA-therapy cannot cure autism, which is almost entirely driven by genetics, but it can treat the anxieties that autistic people often have \cite{taylorAutismEtiology,danforth2018autismMDMA}.
	\item MDMA-therapy is effective for durably improving alexithymia (difficulty in identifying and describing emotions) and reconsolidating maladaptive schemas in the presence of strong alexithymia (often a barrier to reconsolidation) \cite{vanSelfExperience}.
\end{itemize}


How much this will resolve the symptoms of any individual's particular problem is unclear, but the above results for PTSD are extremely promising. 


Note that many mental illness symptoms, such as mania and psychosis, are also activated or exacerbated by stress \cite{winkelPsychosisStress,Umeoka2021stressmania}. Reconsolidation could potentially reduce these symptoms if your stress is significantly caused by maladaptive schemas.

 We think of this work as similar to "Where there is no Doctor."


 This might bring up fear of your social group shunning you for having this belief. We think MDMA might be able to reconsolidate this fear if that fear is maladaptive in some way. For instance, truth seeking may be maladaptive if you only have access to one social group, but in reality you may be able to switch to a different social group that is more tolerant of varying beliefs.

     \item \todo{Reevaluate} It may also be possible to use habit mapping (see \ref{habitMapping}) to guide you in crafting optimal support for your neuroplasticity period. For instance, if my after-work scrolling habit is driven by loneliness, I might arrange to volunteer at an animal shelter on certain days, and to have friends call and talk to me on other days–even if it's just for long enough to get myself started on a different self-care activity.




%\section{[unfinished] Using MDMA to Facilitate Connection with Nature, a Fundamental Human Need}
%\label{sec:nature}
%\todo{If you want to improve your ability to do pro nature things: Mushrooms}
%As \textcite{baxterNatureRelatedness} articulated, “In general, research supports the proposition for a basic psychological need for nature relatedness.” They define the “need for nature relatedness” as “a basic human psychological need to feel a secure and pleasant experiential connection to nature in a cognitive, emotional and physical sense.” Additionally, time in nature correlates with small improvements in blood pressure and stress \cite{caoimheGreenspaceOutcomes}. If you have been excluded from the benefits of nature-relatedness and regular nature exposure by your personal life history or access, we suggest therapeutic MDMA may serve as a catalyst for introducing or strengthening this beneficial relationship in your life.
%
%In order to leverage therapeutic MDMA to create a “secure and pleasant experiential connection with nature” we suggest completing an MDMA session in a peaceful natural setting.
%
%To safely get the most from this exercise, consider:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Arranging the presence of a nature-experienced friend who can assist you in finding a good location and staying safe during the session
%    \item Access to support services and utilities, like bathrooms, food, shelter, and medical care
%    \item Your level of experience and prior experiences with the medicine and dosage you will be using
%    \item Physical hazards, like things you could fall off of and things that could fall on you
%    \item Local plants (like poison ivy, thorn bushes, or plants that would be dangerous if ingested)
%    \item Local wildlife and its likelihood of interacting with your specific location (many snakes like rocky areas near water, bears and rodents can be attracted to food, areas with higher human traffic tend to see less wildlife etc.)
%    \item Insects and other bugs-in the US, especially ticks and mosquitos
%    \item Additional precautions to avoid other humans and maintain legal safety
%    \item Weather appropriate food, water, gear, first aid supplies, and shelter
%\end{itemize}
%
%Although this list may appear daunting, most nature-experienced individuals are accustomed to taking these things into account continuously. Securing a location that takes all these items into consideration may be as simple as arranging to use the backyard of a friend who lives in the countryside or the woods, or having a friend who understands what you are looking for recommend a preferred campsite.
%
%During the actual session, engage all your senses— touch soil with your bare feet, study plants and insects, and feel bark textures. Using psilocybin or ayahuasca can deepen the nature connection and promote permanent increases in feelings of nature-connectedness \cite{forstmannPsilocybinNature}. We suggest caution if you suspect you have major unresolved trauma as it might resurface.
%
%According to \textcite{baxterNatureRelatedness}, increased cognitive and emotional attachment to a specific natural environment “will create a feeling of security and belonging with respect to that particular environment and lead to greater identification with that environment. This, ultimately, will lead a person to feel safer within that environment, which will ease the ability of that environment to elicit the positive effects for the person's psychological well-being.” As such, we posit that further explorations of one's therapeutic target environment can increase the positive effects of this intervention-and that such explorations may not need to be exclusively physical. The nature relatedness of Baxter and Pelletier has a strong cognitive component, and thoughts and feelings about belonging and familiarity are important to their model of how psychological benefits of nature-relatedness are realized. As such, we posit that additional emotional and intellectual explorations of the complexities of nature and our mutually integrated place in it (during or between therapeutic MDMA sessions) are promising as an additional mode of maximizing these benefits.
%
%Repeated experiences in the same natural environment will generate a cognitive and emotional attachment to that area and a stronger sense of place. For example, children who are reared with natural areas readily available may grow up to be more nature connected later in life \cite{windhorst2015growing}. The repeated exploration of a specific natural environment will generate a set of experiences and cognitive representations of the environment that will create a feeling of security and belonging with respect to that particular environment and lead to greater identification with that environment. This, ultimately, will lead a person to feel safer within that environment, which will ease the ability of that environment to elicit the positive effects for the person's psychological well-being.

%\section{Associate Love and Empathy with Cues for Later Recall}
%In this section we speculate that it's possible and useful to associate the positive emotions generated by MDMA with cues, and then later use those cues to recall those emotions in daily life. We don't know of any research on this particular application of cueing/classical conditioning, but the underlaying research on classical conditioning is well established, and we think this particular application is plausible. This may be a productive topic for experimental research.
%
%Revisiting feelings of love, empathy, and safety (such as those experienced during MDMA therapy) can be beneficial in daily life. We think it may help you resolve conflict, enhance interpersonal communication, help you say things you wish you had the courage to say, enhance reconsolidation of distressing schemas, support the cultivation of difficult but healthy habits, or simply help you achieve calm and perspective in moments where those things are needed.
%
%It is possible to enhance your recall of these positive emotions by associating them with one or more specific cues while they are occurring, and then invoking those cues at later times when improved recall of positive emotions is desired. For instance, you might carry a vial of perfume or essential oil, and pull it out to enjoy the scent whenever you are feeling particularly compassionate, loved, or connected to your most positive identities and relationships. MDMA therapy should typically offer an extraordinarily potent opportunity to connect your chosen cue to these positive emotions. Compassion meditation may also offer excellent opportunities. When your cue is associated with positive emotions or “charged,” you can then revisit the scent and the positive memories you have associated with it in those moments when you feel it would be most helpful to ground yourself.
%
%In theory, association and recall should improve as you add more simultaneous cues \todo{Cite}-so if you find this strategy appealing, you may wish to ritualize a variety of simultaneous cues to maximize your access to this tactic. Here are some possibilities. This list prioritizes suggestions that are portable/easy to invoke in many diverse situations (like the flavor of an energy bar or a piece of fruit) or cues that may already be associated with transitioning into a state of mindfulness or positive emotions, like herbal tea. Note that to effectively be used for this strategy, you'll want a cue that you can reserve for this:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item \textbf{Olfactory}: essential oils, fruit or other food, incense, personal care products, a particular tea or coffee drink
%    \item \textbf{Auditory:} music, a bell or chime, or a sound you can make with your own voice or body 
%    \item \textbf{Visual:} a piece of art, a picture of loved ones, an image that symbolizes a beloved identity or occupation, an item from nature
%    \item \textbf{Tactile:} a fidget toy, a heavy piece of jewelry, a textile with a pleasing texture, faux fur, a massage technique, play-dough or similar
%    \item \textbf{Taste:} hard candy, fruit or other food, gum, a particular energy bar or granola bar, your favorite mocktail, a particular tea or coffee drink
%    \item \textbf{Spatial:} your home or bedroom, a favorite place in nature, a place where you often feel connected with loved ones, a place of spiritual significance to you
%    \item \textbf{Temporal:} if there is a time of day when you usually feel good, you may wish to routinely invoke your cue/s at that time for an added boost and an added “charge” to your cues. Also, consider using holidays or happy gatherings as charging opportunities
%    \item \textbf{Proprioceptive and kinesthetic:} specific yoga postures or dance moves; tracing a word or phrase that is meaningful to you with a finger on your skin; self-massage; drawing a particular shape on a chalkboard or in the air in front of you
%    \item \textbf{Conceptual:} read a favorite conceptually important poem, passage, lyric, mantra, or similar. For example, the mantra, “I am becoming consistently capable of lovingly attentive behavior towards myself.”
%\end{itemize}
%
%One example of a multi-cue grounding ritual would be to listen to a particular piece of music while massaging a particular lotion or massage oil into your skin-combining tactile, auditory, and possibly olfactory and conceptual cues.
%
%It may be important to only engage in such a ritual during a part of an MDMA session where you are suffused with positive emotions, rather than a part of an MDMA session where you are focused on processing distressing or traumatic experiences. Note that a cue (or a ritual which conglomerates several cues) must remain “charged” to stay effective because your brain learns that the cue is no longer associated with the original emotional stimulus. If you invoke your cues in distressing situations many times without continuing to build and maintain their association with positive experiences, they will eventually become neutral to you, and then associated with distress. As such, it is important to “re-charge” your cues at a level commensurate with the stress you put on them, in order to continue effectively using this strategy.

  Some degree of liver function must be necessary to metabolize the drug, but there is at least one case study of a patient with advanced liver cirrhosis undergoing cautious, medically-supervised, and effective MDMA-therapy with no adverse effects.


  \item Psychotic episodes induced by therapeutic doses of MDMA without confounding factors are rare \cite{arnovitzSchizophrenia}. One participant out of 174 in the phase III clinical trials reported a psychotic episode (after the trial ended) even though participants with any known personal history of psychotic disorders were excluded from participation \cite{powerTrip,smithSystematic,mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}. Those with family history were not excluded. Published case reports of psychosis following recreational MDMA-ingestion almost always involved confounding factors like co-use of other psychoactive drugs, lack of verification of MDMA ingestion, dehydration, extreme doses, or extreme frequency of use \cite{mcguirePsychosis,patelPsychosis,vaivaPsychosis}. Even if the risk of MDMA-induced psychosis is very low, the consequences of psychosis can be high. Because of this, we suggest that a personal history (or a family history for those with lower risk thresholds) of psychosis is a strong indication to work with a group of professionals who thoroughly understand both psychosis and MDMA. One survey of experts in psychosis and psychedelics reported consensus on psychedelic therapy for psychosis being worth investigating, but that clients should have especially high in-session and post-session support \cite{la2022Psychosis}. We have personally heard of two cases of temporary psychosis triggered by a high-dose psilocybin trip conducted the day after an MDMA-therapy session. This suggests a lack of adequate recuperation between sessions is a major risk factor.

    \item Mania is a dangerous condition that could also conceivably be exacerbated through therapeutic destabilization, though we are not aware of any good data on actual risk. The exclusion criteria for the MDMA-therapy clinical trials may offer some preliminary guidelines: individuals with bipolar I were excluded but those with bipolar II were not \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}. We think a personal history (or family history for those with lower risk tolerance) of problematic mania is a strong indication to work with a team of trusted professionals who understand both mania and MDMA. As with psychosis, we think individuals should have especially high in-session and post-session support.

 Balancing the rarity of case reports of MDMA-induced suicidal ideation, mania, and psychosis with expert-recommended caution probably boils down to individual circumstances and risk tolerance.


  It may also on occasion exacerbate dangerous symptoms like psychosis, mania, or suicidal ideation.

  , and seems to rely on 1) old and incorrect beliefs that psychedelic states imitate psychosis, which is even less relevant to MDMA, which rarely induces hallucinations, 2) focusing on a small number of case studies of psychedelics triggering these conditions, and 3) reasonable extrapolation of the established phenomena of psychedelic therapy inducing psychological destabilization to the exacerbation of these conditions

  The book is essentially my attempt to cope with a dangerous and uncertain world where no-one loves me through rigorously understanding everything and "saving" everyone so that I will be safe. Despite that neurotic motivation, reviewers seem to like the book and don't think I have projected my issues onto it too much.

   %Further complicating matters, a court has issued a restraining order against Sasha Sisko, the individual who requested the retractions, for a series of incidents allegedly involving stalking, harassment, publication of sexual photographs of a minor, manipulative behavior, and lying. While this doesn't disquality the retractions, it does introduce uncertaintly about the truth or appropriate weighting of the reasons for retraction.

   If you haven't had a powerful experience of profound, universal safety, context-specific mismatches will have to be found for each maladaptive schema. \todo{Can we cite Bruce Ecker personal communication?} It may take some effort to find contradictory knowledge or memories of contradictory experiences, but when found, that memory can also be recalled for in-the-moment reconsolidation of specific schemas. We also suspect, based on one case report, that highly-skilled compassion meditation can be directed toward distressing schemas to contradict them.

We also propose that powerful experiences of total safety during a session can later act as a compass you can compare all other experiences to, to deduce if a certain feeling is maladaptive or not. As with real compasses it only measures the direction in which to travel; it can't tell you how far away the destination (reaching particular therapeutic goals) is.

\chapter{Self-Written Case Report of Internalized MDMA Therapy}
\label{casereport}
we include Mark Groeneveld's self-reported experience with this phenomenon as a first step in :
\begin{quotation}
    My first MDMA session (none of the latter sessions were like this) consisted of seemingly-perfect safety and all-encompassing compassion. I comprehended how everyone's maladaptive reactions were due to a variety of learned, no-longer-helpful fears. I also felt that I had a well of inviolable safety inside me so strong I thought I would feel ok (representing emotional resilience, not a lack of empathy) inside even if watched everyone and everything I had ever loved burn to ash in front of me. There was a certain week, after perhaps 10 sessions over two years, when I went walking to deliberately feel my anxiety. At that particular time it felt very good to feel my anxiety for some reason I no longer clearly recall. It was exhausting, and I needed to lay in bed for quite a while afterward to recover. Later I identified this exhaustion as therapy-hangover. That week of walking-reconsolidation is the earliest example I recall of reconsolidation that just "happened" with no deliberate effort or conscious control on my part.
    
    A year or so later after about session 20, I read \cite{lesswrongCoherenceTherapy} describing the process of coherence therapy and wanted to try the process on myself. I thought my first MDMA experience of a well of inviolable safety was the obvious choice for a mismatch for my fear schemas. I activated that knowledge by imagining laying under the tree I was under that first time, how the grass felt on my feel, how the tree trunk felt in my hands. That multisensory visualization seemed to do the trick and activated the well-of-inviolable-safety knowledge strongly enough to start the reconsolidation process. I don't quite recall, but this may have only worked in the two weeks following an MDMA session. It might have taken another 5 MDMA sessions to extend the process past two weeks, at which point I stopped MDMA-therapy as it seemed redundant, and I had some in-hindsight overblown fears about side effects.

    My mental illness was quite bad, so I was anxious to do however much reconsolidation was necessary to fix my issues in as short a time as possible. I spent a couple of hundred hours doing coherence therapy with this knowledge of inviolable safety, which seemed to be powerful enough to reconsolidate any maladaptive schema, just like MDMA. I was limited to two hours a day by therapy-hangover. Eventually I had practiced this process so much that I no longer had to explicitly recall that knowledge of inviolable safety to reconsolidate a maladaptive schema. Any time I noticed a distressing schema I could just “flip a switch” in my mind and start the reconsolidation process. This practice didn't seem to be limited by the typical window of tolerance either; it worked equally well during dissociation and near-overwhelming anxiety.

    Then after a further 300 hours of that, reconsolidation seems to have started happening without conscious intent whenever a maladaptive schema is strongly activated, and I'm not actively avoiding it. It can happen when I'm watching TV, talking to people, or any number of other activities. I can tell when it's happening, but if I'm sufficiently distracted I might not notice. The reconsolidation process seems to be activated by fear; the more afraid I am the higher the intensity of reconsolidation. If I want to turn up the intensity of reconsolidation I can also still deliberately "flip the switch."

    So far I've done about 1100 hours of reconsolidation over the past 2 years. It's made a lot of progress working through my backlog of maladaptive schemas, and I'm much less neurotic than when I started. I started with a truly vast amount of maladaptive fears though, so I have a lot to work through still. It's been incredibly convenient for doing extremely large amounts of therapy without needing a therapist, MDMA, or the overhead of doing an explicit process of understanding my maladaptive schemas, figuring out a mismatch for each one, and then setting up the juxtaposition. It's kept me making therapeutic progress through periods of despair and depression where I surely wouldn't have had the capacity for any sort of typical therapy.

    The only downside I have noticed is that since I have multiple deep maladaptive fears activated virtually every waking moment (I think this is an effect of having virtually zero early childhood attachment), the auto-reconsolidation also starts running every morning once I wake up enough. That inevitably leads to therapy-hangover a bit later. Then the auto-reconsolidation starts up again once the therapy-hangover wears off. I've been therapy hungover a majority of my waking hours for the past two years. I also haven't discovered any way to turn the auto-reconsolidation process off. It goes for about 2 hours a day, limited only by therapy-hangover. Other than "flipping the switch" to increase reconsolidation intensity, the only control I seem to have over the process is that more strongly activating (triggering myself) a certain schema causes auto-reconsolidation to preferential reconsolidate that schema over my other activated maladaptive schemas. This has been unsettling, but I haven't noticed any unambiguous side effects yet other than therapy-hangover, with one exception.

    One day, at the point in this process where I had done maybe 600 hours of reconsolidation, I was riding my bicycle and suddenly felt my sense of self dissolve. My thoughts, awareness, and the external world all felt part of the same unitive experience, no longer divided into self and not-self. This wasn't a dissociative experience, I was still deeply in touch with "my" body, emotions, and sensory experience, and could function appropriately. It seemed like a classic experience of non-dual awareness. The effects waxed and waned over a few months, and brought up a lot of distress about clearly seeing my sense of self as an impermanent construction of my mind, more directly confronting the fact of my eventual death, and a variety of other uncomfortable realizations. Luckily, my auto-reconsolidation process successfully reconsolidated all that distress too. The sense of self settled into a stable, possibly diminished state that became a new and unremarkable normal that doesn't seem accompanied by any dysfunction. Looking back, the event seems like an uncomfortable bump on the road, with neither the old nor new state obviously better than the other. However, that ambivalence might arise from an inability to compare the two stable states, separated by many months, side-by-side. In any case, the auto-reconsolidation capacity seems valuable enough to have made the distress of this experience easily worth it in the long run for me.

    That experience makes me think the initial inviolable-well-of-safety experience was at least partially a non-dual experience, thought it didn't feel like my sense of self was dissolving at the time. I suspect that experience became deeply internalized because it accurately predicted reality in some way. As \textcite{ecker2015misunderstood} stated: "When two mutually contradictory schemas are juxtaposed consciously, the schema that more comprehensively or credibly models reality, and therefore more usefully predicts how the world will behave, reveals the other schema to be false, and the falsified one is immediately transformed [reconsolidated] accordingly." So presumably, inviolable-well-of-inner-safety, while not necessarily representing absolute truth, is more true (at least in the context of my personal lived experience) than my previous set of beliefs that did not include an inviolable well of inner safety. I don't have any metaphysical, ontological, or epistemological insight as to what this means. I also want to note that the initial experience didn't seem sufficient on its own to destabilize my sense of self. That seems to have required re-activating that knowledge for ~600 hours.

    Around hour 1100 I decided to try MDMA again. I was in a particularly tough place and was wondering if I had been wrong about MDMA being redundant with auto-reconsolidation. The session went well. It felt easier to clearly notice what maladaptive schemas were activated, and I have a general, though vague, sense that it added a decent amount of therapeutic efficiency to my regular process. I plan to do it again.

We don't know how well MG's experience reflects the experiences of the few other individuals we have heard about who can do some degree of internalized MDMA therapy. We also don't know if they are correctly interpreting their experience. The process they went through has similarities to intensive insight meditation \cite{ingram2018mastering}. See \ref{selfinsight} for resources on managing this process if you do destabilize your sense of self.

If MG's experience is representative of the phenomenon, the reconsolidation process might simplify down to this sequence in the initial stages:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Notice current distress (fear, anger, sadness, etc.) that isn't obviously situationally-appropriate
    \item Co-activate universal contradictory knowledge
    \item Repeat pairing
    \item Observe markers of target learning nullification. You might not need to continue this step once you've established that the method reliably works.
\end{enumerate}
In the latter stages there are essentially no steps in the sequence because the process no longer depends on deliberate control. The most control they report they have of the process is changing their environment to more strongly activate certain target schemas, which auto-reconsolidation then preferentially reconsolidates.

	\item One trial found that the Therabot AI therapist improves mental health \cite{llmTherapist}. Note that one PubPeer comment claims methodological errors in the study significantly lower the reported effect size \cite{pubpeertherabot}.

**There are multiple practical objectives in healing. Keeping these balanced determines the pace and methods of healing: \todo{Rehome this list?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Healing as soon as possible to minimize suffering and improve function.
    \item Healing that is durable rather than fragile.
    \item Developing skills to process future maladaptive schemas.
    \item Avoiding major disruptions to your life from therapeutic destabilization or other adverse medical and psychological effects.
    \item Minimizing cost.
\end{itemize}

**We know of several anecdotes (including MG's personal experience) indicating that reminders (e.g. music listened to during the session) of the MDMA session can sometimes re-activate the reconsolidation-potential of the MDMA session without MDMA \cite{simmering}.

	\label{def:ipf}
    \item \textbf{Ideal Parent Figure Method:} \todo{}

**We have observed that significant amounts of reconsolidation often seem to happen without deliberate effort in the weeks and months following a session. We speculate this phenomenon may occur when the session destabilizes an attractor state enough to allow natural, gradual shifts of schemas over time \cite{hayes2020complex}.

**Based on MG's experience, we speculate that there is a daily mismatch limit (one date point suggests about 2 hours). At that point, reconsolidation exhaustion inhibits the practice. Sleep (or possibly just a sufficient length of time) seems to rejuvenate the ability. Reconsolidating to your limit every day will likely maximize your progress if you have the time and energy.

In addition to the explicit process of maladaptive schema investigation detail in Section \ref{uncovering}, we think any defense cascade activation (see Section \ref{sec:signsofdc} for symptoms) or non-useful fear, anger, anxiety, etc. in daily life outside immediately dangerous situations is a valuable indicator of maladaptive schemas. Furthermore, we pervasively practice subtle, barely-noticeable avoidance around a wide swath of uncomfortable ideas, places, people, etc. We think noticing and going toward the object of avoidance is usually a fruitful endeavor.

Note that long term use of benzodiazepines is addictive, ineffective (because of tolerance), and causes long-term cognitive impairment that persists even after discontinuation \cite{barkerBenzo}.

In our experience LLMs also output garbage information on therapy in general because the existing corpus of knowledge about therapy in large part consists of a wide variety of a-mechanistic and conflicting therapy frameworks that each have their own language.

   \item MDMA may on rare occasion provoke destabilizing shifts to one's sense of self or beliefs about existence.

    \item Not much is known about when MDMA-therapy will make dangerous symptoms like psychosis and suicidal ideation better or worse. See \ref{sec:safety} for more information.


%Observations (summarized by \textcite{fedduciaMDMAMemoryReconsolidation}, and additionally our own observations of trip reports) of post-session reports and MG's personal experience frequently match up with the signs (emotional non-reactivation, symptom cessation, and effortless permanence \cite{eckerUnlocking}) of a successfully reconsolidated schema. %MG's personal experience and our observation of trip reports also indicate that once a maladaptive schema is emotionally activated and non-avoidance is practiced, MDMA permanently dissolves it without any further effort. It remains unknown what particular source(s) of information provide the mismatch, or by what, if any, mechanisms MDMA facilitates reconsolidation other than safety and empathy.

, or it at least some phenomena that operates in roughly the same way and produces similar outcomes.

Frankly, it is not possible to do psychedelic therapy, or any type of therapy, without relying on someone's varyingly-informed opinions. We think MDMA-therapy shows a lot of promise and want to provide a manual with a lot of provisional elements, because the heat death of the universe will arrive before every little nuance has been rigorously studied.

If you feel uncomfortable assuming the resistance is maladaptive, you can approach the truth of the schema's beliefs or emotional responses with agnosticism, "It may or may not be true or helpful; I will stay present with the feeling to learn why the schema exists and how it influences me." If you can't focus on the resistance schema and another schema is taking precedence, that's ok. You can revisit the resistance later.

In our experience, your thoughts are also a reliable indicator of where in the reconsolidation process you are. Your thoughts often revolve around strongly activated schemas. For example, if your schema involves fear and a belief that you're dying, you may find your thoughts saying things like "I'm dying", "I'm afraid", "Death is horrible", "How could that person be comfortable with the thought of eventual death?", "Hospice facilities are scary", etc. Those thoughts will likely feel compelling. When reconsolidation finishes, those thoughts become less compelling or may shift into compassion for yourself or others. You can watch as your beliefs shift too. During a PTSD schema activation, you may believe, to some extent (often vocalized in your inner monologue), for example, that you're being attacked. As that schema reconsolidates, you can see how that belief dissolves, and you realize you're not actually being attacked. Sometimes our beliefs may stay the same while the emotional valence (positive, neutral, or negative) shifts. For example, you may have had anxiety about the thought of dying later in life. After reconsolidation, you still know you will die, but it will no longer be distressing \footnote{It could also be that the belief that feels like it stayed the same is not the schema you actually reconsolidated. It might be that a second, unnoticed schema, like "death is bad" was reconsolidated and that belief actually dissipated.}.

	\item Metacognitive perspective / therapeutic de-centering; all maladaptive schemas might be clearly seen as incorrect or no long contextually appropriate

the phase II long term follow-up study showed preliminary evidence that the effects are durable \cite{jeromeMDMALongTerm}.
 Long term (1 year) follow up has only been conducted with 103 individuals and no study can investigate all possible health effects \cite{jeromeMDMALongTerm}.

% Refer to \textit{The PSIP model. An introduction to a novel method of therapy: Psychedelic Somatic Interactional Psychotherapy} for one view of the role of the defense cascade in psychedelic therapy \cite{razviPSIP}.

Even worse, there is so little rigorous evidence on inpatient hospitalization that it's not clear it actually reduces suicide rates in the long run \cite{borecky2019reweighing}.

This book primarily focuses on the "psycho" part of "biopsychosocial," with secondary focus on the "social."


Symptom worsening may often be a sign of impending improvement, especially given further reconsolidation \cite{complex}. \textcite{complex} reports "Critical fluctuations and critical slowing have been well-documented to herald transition across a number of systems in nature...," but "Too few studies have been conducted on early warning signals in psychotherapy to draw firm conclusions, but the findings thus far suggest that nonlinear and discontinuous changes and periods of rising variability in symptoms and patterns of pathology occur in psychotherapy, and that these fluctuations predict symptom reduction and the development of more healthy patterns of functioning."

In reality it seems like therapy is often more complicated than a simple transition from one maladaptive state to one adaptive state. 

Therapeutic destabilization can make things feel or be worse at times \cite{olthofDestabilization}, and reconsolidation may only yield visible results at unforeseen turning points as the network of schemas shifts in complicated ways. Furthermore, we think more reconsolidation is the only durable way through destabilization. This claim needs more justification, especially since we are asking you to do more of they type of thing that may have destabilized you in the first place. The literature on destabilization is unfortunately poor.

Destabilization may also consist of simply activating previously-dissociated or avoided memories. This may be overwhelming, or may activate debilitating defense cascade states.

We think another complexity, destabilization (psychological turbulence or worstening of symtpms), is commonly a challenging part of MDMA therapy. You can think of it as standing up. Sitting and standing are both stable positions. The transition positions between the two are unstable, but must be passed through if you want to walk anywhere \cite{olthofDestabilization}. Therapeutic destabilization is associated with better outcomes later in therapy, however it can negatively impact your life if it is severe enough and not managed well. We think the following is a likely schema-based description of destabilization: Initially, multiple schemas and defense cascade states may work together to create a relatively stable but unhealthy pattern of behavior and emotions. Unlearning all or most of the schemas in that pattern may be necessary to reach a healthier pattern, but that can't be done all at once. Starting the reconsolidation process triggers an intermediary period where some schemas still exist but no longer form as stable of a pattern. We suspect some of them may react to the new state by strengthening and possibly activating defense cascade states. We are not aware of any papers demonstrating this, but, based on a number of anecdotal reports from reddit.com/r/mdmatherapy, we think it's highly likely that psychedelic therapy tends to produce stronger destabilization (and more rapid therapeutic progress) than traditional psychotherapy. See Section \ref{assessDestabilizationRisk} for tips on assessing this risk. We recommend \textcite{hayes2020complex} for a more thorough theoretical explanation of destabilization.

Another sign of an immanent shift is lowered "pull" (critical slowing) of the old state. 

Complex systems frequently have nonlinear dynamics, where improvement, worsening, and destabilization can come at unforeseen moments. 

Activating and feeling the emotions of the target schema is necessary to enable reconsolidation \cite{ecker2015misunderstood} \footnote{Emotional activation is necessary because the schemas addressed in therapy almost always involve strong emotions. One can reconsolidate schemas that don't involve emotion without emotional activation.}. We think of it as focus-meditation, where you hold the feeling or belief of the schema in focus and gently dismiss distracting thoughts about, for instance, how beautiful the trees are. This can be deeply uncomfortable, but in our experience the MDMA almost always makes it bearable. The discomfort will be temporary; MDMA-induced reconsolidation will dissipate it over 10s of minutes. Insightful thoughts about how trauma impacted you or insights into human behavior may arise. Spend time on them if they feel cathartic or important. Leave them until after the session if they don't feel cathartic or important, reserving limited session time for reconsolidation or new experiences of profound wellbeing. It may also help to hold the schema with compassionate curiosity and agnosticism with regard to its truth. We have observed that activating and feeling the emotions of maladaptive schemas is a necessary part of MDMA therapy. Thinking can be useful, but only if it occurs in conjunction with feeling. Thinking by itself is a waste.

Once you've found one of those, stay present with it, and it will reconsolidate.

We've noticed that successful reconsolidation presents as either: 1) the schema gradually dissipating or becoming uninteresting, or 2) negative emotions transforming into positive ones. 

We have observed (1 data point) that you can later use (with extensive practice) this knowledge of deep inner wellbeing to mismatch almost any maladaptive schema without the need for MDMA. We think that ability is enormously useful. See Section \ref{sec:moreReconsolidation} for instructions. (regular life will rarely be total bliss, but the experience does point you in the right direction)



When a schema is healed you should notice that although the pain and maladaptive beliefs and behavior are diminished, a level of caution remains. If this caution is helpful rather than overwhelming, then this is the schema in its adaptive, rather than maladaptive form. This caution will aid you in avoiding future harm.

PTSD makes us feel as though we are by our nature isolated; MDMA can help people feel as though they are by their nature connected to one another. This may be one of the central mechanisms of healing that both therapy and MDMA provide.

 For further discussion of how to decide when to stop using medicine, see Section \ref{sec:moreReconsolidation}.

 The term was introduced by John Welwood, a Buddhist teacher and psychotherapist. 

 interpret the effects of MDMA and the reconsolidation process as spiritual., Because MDMA can produce profound spiritual experiences for those individuals who interpret their MDMA experience in a spiritual way, it may be important to take care to avoid spiritual bypass if MDMA experiences are to actually facilitate healing. In particular, the profundity of many MDMA experiences may lead one to feel that focusing on painful maladaptive schemas is simply no longer necessary; however, without that focus, the schemas will not be reconsolidated, and healing will not be accomplished to the degree it otherwise could be.

 The intense emotions and beliefs you felt during the session may have been the schemas that have been negatively affecting your life. You will react and think differently now after the emotions and beliefs of your schema have updated. 

 You might have had profound feelings or thoughts about various belief systems, sociocultural systems, organizations, etc. MDMA can spur profound insights. The feelings of trust, safety, and increased perspective inherent to many MDMA experiences can cause us to take the profound thoughts and feelings we have during those experiences as objective truth, which they may or may not be \cite{hartogsohn2018meaning}. Psychedelics inflate feelings of meaning. Rather, MDMA can offer a new perspective based on a state of heightened, but incomplete compassion and safety. Real insights may get mixed up with inaccurate interpretations. Even in these exceptional states of consciousness, all your still-unconscious emotions are deeply influencing your beliefs and feelings. Seek high quality critiques of your beliefs and incorporate beliefs into rigorous higher level frameworks \cite{saganDemon}. Correct for cognitive biases and aim for a balanced perspective when evaluating new ideas \cite{galefScoutMindset}. will more reliably lead you to what is objectively accurate or helpful for your life.

  As \textcite{ecker2015misunderstood} stated: "When two mutually contradictory schemas are juxtaposed consciously, the schema that more comprehensively or credibly models reality, and therefore more usefully predicts how the world will behave, reveals the other schema to be false, and the falsified one is immediately transformed [reconsolidated] accordingly." So presumably, inviolable-well-of-inner-safety, while not necessarily representing absolute truth, is more true (at least in the context of my personal lived experience) than my previous set of beliefs that did not include an inviolable well of inner safety.

  Predictions and the belief component of schemas seem like the same thing. 

Feels like they have to save the world with this book to feel safe. 

    \item Many other constructs in psychology are similarly a-mechanistic, or only defined in terms of other a-mechanistic constructs.

(e.g. "I am bad," as opposed to low-level schemas that control, say body temperature, which remain largely unaltered)

If you have significant uncertainty about your particular issue, it may be worth trying MDMA therapy if you meet the safety criteria (see Section \ref{sec:safety}) and the cost is reasonable. It offers some chance of addressing the problem if it is schema-based, and very low risk if you don't have any emotional issues, though destabilization is a significant risk if your problem is schema-based. 

Questionaires may be "valid" in the sense that they correlate well to other questionaires, but questionaire 
These assessments strongly depend on the patient or clinician's understanding of the semanic meaning of words in the questionaire, what is normal, the client's capacity for accurate introspection and reporting, etc.

The brain actively controls attention to obtain the most relevant information in any particular context \cite{clark2015surfing}. 



 and the principles of Self Determination Theory (Appendix \ref{sec:sdt})


  and is largely, in our opinion, a reasonable extrapolation of those sections

  These mechanisms likely all rely on some combination of innate biology and learned schemas that are different for different individuals.
    \item Is a single therapeutically-relevant schema like "no one love me" represented as a single Bayesian prior or set of priors?

"a large, complex network of largely unconscious schemas developed into a perception/action model that was helpful at one point \cite{clark2015surfing}." The brain is a vast network of almost-entirely unconscious schemas that  process sensory input, model reality, model its own model, control action, and control attention itself, all wound up together in one immensely complicated recursive loop.

This is a fundamental process enabling adaption to new situations, but a few things can inhibit this updating process by preventing this conscious contradiction, causing our schemas to keep operating in older, no-longer-adaptive ways.:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Avoidance:} Escapist habits, distrusting your thoughts or body, inability to tolerate uncomfortable emotions, escapist habits, fear that updating a schema will make you vulnerable in some way, denial, rationalization, total avoidance of the thing you're maladaptively afraid of, etc. \cite{hayes2020complex}. There is such a thing as healthy avoidance, which is temporary and helps you cope in non-destructive ways until you have the space to process.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Resources or Skills:} Not having a quiet moment or space to investigate and feel your emotions. Being unsure about the reasons for your reactions or how to handle them. Or you may be able to notice and label feelings, sometimes called Alexithymia \cite{hogeveen2021alexithymia}. Making schemas explicit, like with labeling, can aid the brain's built in contradiction-detection processes.
    \item \textbf{Fight-or-Flight or Dissociation:} These defense cascade states frequently inhibit prediction error \cite{razviPSIP}.
    \item \textbf{Schemas May Just be Hard to Update in General:} All complex decision systems, such as the brain, must trade off between multiple goals. The psychiatrist Scott Alexander speculates in a blog post that the brain must trade off between two failure modes (these failure modes are well-established in artificial neural networks): overgeneralization and over-specificity \cite{alexanderMountains}. Say that Alice was mean to you one time. An overgeneralized prediction may be that all people are mean all the time. An over-specific prediction may be that Alice is only mean on Mondays, while wearing a blue shirt, when it is sunny out. Neither of these predictions are useful or correct; the correct prediction might be "sometimes people have bad days and take it out on others." Learning the correct prediction is difficult, and the brain must often make hasty guesses because learning a prediction too slowly can be risky in threatening situations. All of this possibly results in a messy system that sometimes generates overly-strong and durable predictions that require unusual circumstances to contradict.
    \item \textbf{Pervasive Threat Expectations Impede Updating:} \textcite{berghSelfEvidencing} hypothesizes that high-level schemas predicting pervasive threat broadly impair awareness of contradictory evidence. \textcite{alexanderPrecision} provides a more accessible summary of the paper.
\end{itemize}
The schema stays stuck in its maladaptive configuration, replaying and creating problems when these continually inhibit prediction error for a maladaptive schema \cite{rachmanProcessing,eckerUnlocking}.

We suspect there are opioid-mediated dissociative states that don't neatly fit into the defense cascade model. Some individuals "...feel sober, or bored or sleepy as if they could get up and go about their day." during MDMA sessions where the individual can presumably move and think fairly well, but remains emotionally numbed \cite{razviPSIP}. While we can't be sure that this phenomenon is always opioid-mediated, we think it is often because emotional numbing is a known effect of opioids \cite{lanius2018review}, and we aren't aware of any other mechanism that would cause such a degree of numbing as to make an MDMA trip feel boring.

, or the various pseudoscientific beliefs popular in mainstream psychotherapy

We suspect that in some cases a stable state of mental illness is actually only semi-stable, and one can transition to an even worse and potentially more stable state in certain unusual conditions. People occasionally uncover horrifying memories of abuse during MDMA therapy, and after the session end up with stable and much worse symptoms than before. We suspect this new state already existed in an inactive state, but was unreachable because of strong avoidance mechanisms that prevented access to that memory. Psychedelics are famous for their capacity to decrease avoidance. Completely avoiding these memories for the rest of your life is not healthy, as the schemas that abuse creates are generally important and active in peoples' lives. It's conceivable that a skilled therapist who you align well with could help you gently ease into these distressing memories instead of confronting them all at once. However, psychedelic experiences are famously difficult to control, and we think it's likely harder to maintain an easing-in pace during MDMA therapy. This symptom-worsening issue is further complicated in practice because people are sometimes avoiding a multitude of distressing things and possibly multiple associated even-more maladaptive and stable states. It's also easily possible that this even-worse state is not stable, and will naturally resolve to an even-better state of mental health.

The Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics (REBUS) model hypothesizes that LSD, psilocybin, and DMT work by relaxing all high level (abstract beliefs, unlike low-level prios that, say, maintain homeostasis) priors \cite{carhart2019rebus}. Incoming interoceptive sensory information gains relative strength compared to typically-entrenched maladaptive priors. This normal interoceptive information is then sufficient to reconsolidate the maladaptive priors when those priors are activated during psychedelic-assisted therapy. Relaxation of all high level priors also explains other features of these drugs like hallucinations.

MDMA causes much less hallucination than psilocybin, so it likely doesn't relax all high level priors \cite{studerus2010psychometric}. 

% \Section{Factors for Success}
% \label{assessDestabilizationRisk}
% We suspect the conditions below increase the chances of lasting healing and reduce the risk of destabilization and symptom worsening. While meeting all of them is not necessary for success, the more you have, the easier it will be. A good therapeutic alliance with a mental health professional can probably offset a lack of some of these. Many individuals with a history of trauma or mental illness have absorbed an "I have to do it all myself" or "these things were so long ago I should be over them already" attitude from difficult life circumstances, which makes it hard for them to feel they deserve supportive care. We hope this list will assist you in giving yourself credit for the difficulty of your endeavors, and help you give yourself permission to seek more support if that would be right for you. Consider these carefully when deciding what degree of professional guidance you need:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Access to resources: stable housing, financial security, stable healthy relationships, free time to process without compromising material stability, and friends or family skilled in emotional support.
%     \item Understanding of healthy emotional behaviors (awareness of difficult moods and tools to manage them, conflict resolution, etc.).
%     \item Some degree of impulse control
%     \item Grit to navigate challenges in the healing process. Capacity to do between-session reconsolidation. Motivation to experiment with therapeutic methods to find what works for you.
%     \item Time for and access to a secure and inviting space for your sessions, post-session rest, and reflection.
%     \item Independence from those who have traumatized you, especially if they might react poorly to your insights and improvements. Most maladaptive schemas protected you at one point in your life. Dismantling these protections while you are still in a dangerous situation may be risky.
%     \item A habit of inquiring why you have the beliefs and behaviors you do. Acknowledgement that many of them are strongly influenced by psychological and social factors, particularly from early-childhood \cite{brownAttachmentDisturbances}.
%     \item Ability to identify dysregulation.
%     \item Good therapeutic alliance if you're working with a mental health professional \cite{fluckiger2018alliance}.
%     \item Absence of severe mental health problems such as CPTSD, attachment disorders, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders, and personality disorders. We aren't aware of any high-quality research on how to predict destabilization and symptom worsening, but we strongly suspect the trauma reactions we just listed are major factors. If we had to pick one scale you can rate yourself with we would suggest the Maladaptive Schema Scale by \textcite{maladaptiveSchemaScale}. Unfortunately we aren't sure how to translate a specific score to specific recommendations on much good professional assistance is important for helping you in managing destabilization. The best we can recommend is using this as a vibe-check that you integrate with the other complexities of your personal situation.

We believe MDMA therapy presents a significant increase in the potential cost-quality curve of therapy and provides a much-needed tool for cases that haven't responded well to other approaches \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2,mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial}.

Outcome measures continued to deacrease after each of the three doses administered during the trials, suggesting additional doses would further increase healing \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial,mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}. 

\footnote{MDMA is sold in hydrochloride salt form, and all stated masses are masses of the hydrochloride salt form \cite{liechtiInteractions}. MDMA is made as a racemic (equal) mixture of the R-MDMA and S-MDMA enantiomers (a right or left-handed version of a molecule), though it is possible to purify either enantiomer \cite{straumann2024racemic}. They have different effects.}

 is highly controversial. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to figure out how likely LLM therapy is to help in the current (2025) information environment of high AI attitude polarization, minimal high quality research, high rates of technological change, and wildly conflicting reports of LLMs providing everything from desperately needed and healthy help to fueling delusions of grandiosity.

  MDMA's effects of safety and empathy also decrease avoidance and facilitate staying present with difficult schemas, one of the prerequisites of reconsolidation.

This does not imply that destabilization due to abusive or incompetent therapists or guides is helpful. 

These issues can presumably be solved, at least in part, though the methods outlined in this book for reconsolidating any maladaptive schema. 

These drive unusually-strong attention to ambiguous sensory information and interpret it as persistence of threatening illness or injury.

Fixing these issues might require reconsolidating the high-pervasive-threat schema and any schemas driving avoidance of bodily awareness in addition to the specific symptom-producing schema, since the former two continually reinforce the latter. We don't know if MDMA can facilitate reconsolidation of this type of symptom-producing schema, but the high-pervasive-threat and avoidance schemas sound like the type MDMA can help with. Any practice that directly increases attention to bodily sensations may also help if the practice doesn't get categorized as a threat itself.

This might involve using the type of touch or movement that would produce symptom perception, but started at a gentle enough level that doesn't actually cause symptom perception. Gradually increasing intensity over time will gradually raise the learned threshold that triggers symptom perception. This suggests things like sports, yoga, accupuncture, gradual progressive strength training, etc. may work.

We wanted to include our relevant personal motivations and attachments so that the reader can better contextualize this book within a greater truth-seeking process. Unfortunately we quickly ran into the issue of our motivations being impenetrable tangles of conscious and unconscious beliefs. We could have tried to break off a few of these that seem most relevant, but even that assumes our honest self-analytic capacity is operating accurately. Self-analysis is one portion of the brain's predictive-processing network trying to model the whole network. It is fundamentally impossible for small neural networks to perfectly model larger neural networks. Additionally, self-analysis also seems heavily optimized for self-deception about a great many things. Sorry.

\footnote{I had a long list of attachments and beliefs that are important to how and why I wrote this book. However, over 1000 hours of reconsolidation has taught me that accurate self-assessment of foundational beliefs-and why I have those beliefs-is at best tenuous. Many explicitly stated beliefs are incorrect post-hoc constructed narratives and rationales that obscure more complex, incoherent, or unpleasant sets of unconscious schemas. You'll have to infer my values from reading the book.}

T.H. and M.G. then shared writing, editing, concept development, and research. We shared editing equally.

 We've included a few of our relevant motivations, attachments, and beliefs despite the fact that complete self-knowledge is fundamentally impossible and people are heavily incentivized to self-deceive in certain ways. We've also chosen to not include some less-palatable beliefs and motivations in the interest of not turning off potential readers.

 \footnote{We're assuming that people want their actions to be aligned with their moral beliefs, and that their set of fundamental moral beliefs should not contradict each other. In other words, their action-belief system is coherent.}

 It may be impossible to really determine if you should some of these groups have worth. Then the question becomes: how should I act if there's a 50/50 (or whatever) chance a group has worth?

\todo{How do you put yourself in their (possibly the opposing team) shoes?}
Cultivating empathy can enrich your connection to others and spur compassionate action, thus creating healthier societies and decreasing suffering. Research has identified three forms of empathy: affective empathy, cognitive empathy, and empathic concern. "Affective empathy” refers to having an emotional experience you believe you are sharing with another. Unfortunately, we are often inaccurate in our assessment of what emotions other beings are actually experiencing. "Cognitive empathy” refers to our ability to logically understand how others feel, and also why they feel the way they do-what all the contributing factors are, and how those factors work. Finally, "empathic concern” refers to our desire for others to have good things.

Among the helping professions, higher levels of affective empathy are associated with burnout and poor client care. When a caregiver is experiencing high levels of affective empathy, they are naturally motivated to address their own distress by helping the client with what they perceive is wrong-which may or may not have anything to do with what the client actually needs or is actually experiencing. In contrast, in these same populations, higher levels of cognitive empathy and empathic concern are protective against burnout and correlate to higher quality client care. As such, when we talk about cultivating empathy, we are talking about increasing your levels of cognitive empathy and empathic concern. To illustrate: suppose your friend is a father, who feels angry and powerless about his teenage daughter's choice to dye her hair purple. You might feel affective empathy towards his powerlessness, relating to the way his status in the community might be negatively impacted by her choices. However, it may be that his distress is not connected to feelings about status, but only to concern about her welfare and what the change may signal about his daughter's mental health. Your ability to effectively exercise compassion towards this father is contingent on the quality of your cognitive empathy-your ability to accurately assess and communicate where his needs, feelings and concerns are actually coming from.

Much of the existing research on increasing positive emotional states of kindness and compassion, associated with cognitive empathy and empathic concern, is focused on compassion meditation and loving kindness meditation. We feel that these practices are worth a try for most people (see \textcite{lkMeditation} for instructions), as they are correlated with a number of positive outcomes. We also speculate that therapeutic MDMA sessions may offer an opportunity to jump-start or supercharge the process of cultivating cognitive empathy and empathic concern. Completing a compassion meditation during the MDMA session could be helpful for this. Alternatively, you might focus specifically on cultivating cognitive empathy through the following contemplative exercise:

During a session, look at photos of other beings and consider what you share with them, what facilitates their wellbeing, what they deserve, and what obligations you may have to them given the significance of their moral worth. As with a classical compassion meditation, you might start with yourself or someone who you find easy to generate compassion for, and then slowly by degrees work your way out through other categories of beings you may not feel as connected to. We believe non-human animals (and conceivably current or future artificial intelligences, though without any widely-accepted and experimentally validated theory of consciousness this is highly uncertain) are an important target for consideration and compassion because, as a large group of biologists and philosophers recently asserted \cite{newYorkAnimal}:

\begin{quotation}
    First, there is strong scientific support for attributions of conscious experience [having subjective experiences; not necessarily being self-aware] to other mammals and to birds.
    
    Second, the empirical evidence indicates at least a realistic possibility of conscious experience in all vertebrates (including reptiles, amphibians, and fishes) and many invertebrates (including, at minimum, cephalopod mollusks, decapod crustaceans, and insects)

    Third, when there is a realistic possibility of conscious experience in an animal, it is irresponsible to ignore that possibility in decisions affecting that animal. We should consider welfare risks and use the evidence to inform our responses to these risks.
\end{quotation}

We posit that taking a holistic approach to compassion and cognitive empathy can avoid major oversights in our personal actions and beliefs, allowing us to maximize the benefits of a more connected and compassionate life by exercising compassion in areas where we otherwise might not have. Additionally, we posit that formalizing your compassionate impulses can sometimes lead to better prioritization and better outcomes. Both of these practices may assist us in expanding our moral intuition into new situations.

We also recommend that practitioners be cautious of major ethical readjustments during or after an MDMA trip, just as you would be with major life choice changes. Particularly high caution is warranted around actions that involve harm to some beings in the pursuit of a greater goal \cite{askellSelfServing}. While we are often faced with difficult choices, these types of actions often have toxic personal, organizational, and reputational effects. We recommend thinking through the many effects of your actions, including their larger systemic and relational impacts. Such actions are also commonly used as a, perhaps unconscious, rationalization of unconscious ego-related schemas. We suggest that deeper exploration and reconsolidation of maladaptive schemas, including those listed in Section \ref{uncovering}, will help you better align personal actions with the needs of all beings.

When recovering from trauma, it is common for one's moral framework to become intertwined with maladaptive schemas-leading to unhealthy ethical frameworks like the "I must save the world to be a valid person” belief Gabor Mate discusses in "The Body Says No.” (Also see Section \ref{psychogenic} on psychogenic illnesses) At the same time, cultures and institutions often dismiss major harms-current examples relevant to mainstream US culture include childbirth trauma and the trauma of living through a mass extinction; past examples include enslavement or "resettlement schools.” In situations like these, we posit that traumatized survivors represent an important repository of experience, essential for crafting cultural shifts that could help avoid the future repetition of these and similar harms. As such, it is important not to dismiss the moral intuition generated by traumatic experience, but rather to approach it with compassionate curiosity, as one important source of insight among many.

\section{Cognitive Flexibility and Truth-Seeking}
We assert that cognitive flexibility is both highly important and lower than it should be for most people in the modern world. Intense tribalism seems to be a major reason why. It may have been selected for in a past where survival was much more tenuous than in it today for most people, and where societies were much smaller. While we still need to form coalitions (family, workplace relationships, friendships, etc.) to accomplish almost anything, we suspect our tribal tendency is overpowered for life in relatively safe nation-states. This creates all sorts of problems, such as poor governmental policy because of people vote based on identity \cite{klein2020Polarized} rather than good policy, being shunned for believing or doing things that have become a marker of belonging to a rival group, etc.

As the psychologist David Pinsof says on their blog about self-deception being a core aspect of tribalism \cite{pinsof2024Truth}:
\begin{quotation}
	We're hyper-skeptical of claims made by the outgroup-the people we fear, dislike, and distrust. And we believe ingroup-flattering absurdities ... because it is instrumentally rational for us to do so. The benefits of status and tribal solidarity often outweigh the costs of false beliefs, particularly if those beliefs are vague, unactionable, or unfalsifiable.
\end{quotation}
We may also embrace harmful beliefs when most of the benefits accrue to us personally, but the costs are spread out among many people. It's like emitting pollution; it's often the cheapest option for you, but the damage is spread over so many people that they have a very difficult time coordinating with each other to stop it \cite{coaseTheorem}.

It is common to perceive obviously false beliefs in the out-group. But how do you know they are wrong and you aren't? The human capacity for self-deception must be strong enough to make at least one of you wrong about a supposedly obvious fact, and we have no foolproof a priori reason to believe it is them instead of us. We think self-deception frequently relies on avoidance of discomfort (being wrong, the potential for being shunned, knowing you have done something harmful, etc.). MDMA notably increases tolerability of discomfort, and therefore we speculate it could be useful as an avoidance-decreasing tool useful for deliberately gathering more accurate evidence and coming to more accurate beliefs about things people commonly deceive themselves about. For instance, during an MDMA session you might consider the implications of a hated political group being correct about some important piece of policy. This might also bring up some fears that you can then reconsolidate. Presumably, some improvements to cognitive flexibility depend on perceiving that there are attainable alternative social situations for you. If you are trapped in a cult without even a slight perceived chance (even unconscious) of possible escape, MDMA therapy might just help you better adapt to that situation.

We live in a world of pervasive threats, fear-based messaging, and out-group demonization/dehumanization. Because of this, we believe additional strategies beyond reconsolidation and avoidance-reduction are likely necessary to maintain cognitive flexibility and compassion in the long-run. We have a few recommendations for this:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{The Scout Mindset} by Julia Galef \cite{galefScoutMindset}. "When it comes to what we believe, humans see what they want to see. In other words, we have what Julia Galef calls a "soldier” mindset. From tribalism and wishful thinking, to rationalizing in our personal lives and everything in between, we are driven to defend the ideas we most want to believe—and shoot down those we don't.

    But if we want to get things right more often, argues Galef, we should train ourselves to have a 'scout' mindset. Unlike the soldier, a scout's goal isn't to defend one side over the other. It's to go out, survey the territory, and come back with as accurate a map as possible. Regardless of what they hope to be the case, above all, the scout wants to know what's actually true.
    
    In The Scout Mindset, Galef shows that what makes scouts better at getting things right isn't that they're smarter or more knowledgeable than everyone else. It's a handful of emotional skills, habits, and ways of looking at the world—which anyone can learn."
    \item \textit{Why We're Polarized} by Ezra Klein discusses the self-reinforcing feedback loops between our fears and identities and the behavior of the media and politicians \cite{klein2020Polarized}. This cycle increases polarization, political dysfunction, and separates us from each other. This book is more about understanding the role of identity in politics than suggestions on how to improve the situation.
    \item \textit{How Minds Change: The Surprising Science of Belief, Opinion, and Persuasion} by David McRaney is an excellent survey of the topic \cite{mcraneyMinds}.
    \item The blog post \textit{Trapped Priors As A Basic Problem Of Rationality} by Scott Alexander lays out a mechanistic explanation of how false beliefs can become entrenched despite abundant contradictory evidence \cite{alexanderTrapped}.
\end{itemize}


This might bring up some fears that you can then reconsolidate. Presumably, some improvements to cognitive flexibility depend on perceiving that there are attainable alternative social situations for you. If you are trapped in a cult without even a slight perceived chance (even unconscious) of possible escape, MDMA therapy might just help you better adapt to that situation.

We don't know what this phenomenon is. A few weeks roughly equals the length of time of a certain type of increased neuroplasticity that \textcite{nardouMDMAPlasticity} found following MDMA sessions in mice. However, that lab's results with psilocybin have failed to replicate, calling their MDMA results into question too \cite{Lu2025noplasticity}. It could be that something about your MDMA session or your expectations about MDMA therapy temporarily deactivated the set of schemas that cause your problems. Perhaps one schema of a set of self-reinforcing schemas deactivated, and then the whole network of self-reinforcing schemas deactivated. Those schemas may eventually re-activate in the presence of their regular triggers if they are not reconsolidated.

We recommend spending more effort on, and experimenting with sober reconsolidation exercises (see Section \ref{sec:moreReconsolidation}) in this period rather than more frequent MDMA use if this phenomenon occurs for you. You may even find that maxing-out your reconsolidation capacity every day will deliver very large amounts of therapeutic progress. Developing the skill of sober reconsolidation can reduce your therapeutic reliance on MDMA and allow reconsolidation in a wide variety of circumstances where MDMA use is not appropriate. When well-developed it could also allow faster healing because the safety and logistical considerations of MDMA therapy are no longer limiting.

You might go through cycles of noticing new and interesting sensations or thoughts that feel really good at first then dissipate with time. We think this is positively-valenced prediction error caused by bringing attention to previously-avoided things. The error will gradually update your schemas until the new sensations or thoughts become the unremarkable new normal.

This was found in clinical settings where physical activity was low and temperature moderate.

Hyponatremia can become severe if the individual sweats a lot without replenishing the lost salt, or drinks large amounts of unsalted fluid, as sometimes occurs at dance parties \cite{vanOverheatingAlcohol}.

 Replacing fluids and sodium will become more important to avoid dangerous heat illness (MDMA further raises body temperature by $0.2$-$0.8^{\circ}$C or $0.4$-$1.4^{\circ}$F\cite{liechti2014effects}) and hyponatremia if the environment is hot enough to cause sustained heavy sweating during the session (MDMA can further increase sweating \cite{colcott2024side}).

  These are assuredly a limited subset of the full set of disorders associated with childhood trauma.
