Psychedelics are capable of catalyzing important insights but they (less so MDMA) are also capable of generating a wide variety of compelling yet ungrounded conceptual hallucinations. Psychedelics increase the strength of your imagination, thereby weakening your mind's ability to differentiate between reality and imaginary \cite{quantaRealityImagination}. Please critique your insights with mainstream academic philosophy, neuroscience, and physics before concluding that the tree next to you harbors malevolent intentions or that the entity you talked to was real. It was in all likelihood a construct of your subconscious mind.


The "three month rule" started out as Anne Shuglin's educated guess for how often you can take MDMA while maintaining long-term effectiveness. While she was a respected psychedelic researcher, one person's guess is not a reliable guideline. Many people use MDMA more often than three months and don't experience a decline of effect. 

If you are significantly constrained by time, care resources, or critical responsibilities, you should take care to not go too deep in one session, otherwise you might get into a too-much-too-soon scenario and experience more destabilization than you can handle.

We suspect that such an individual would actually have an even deeper attachment to living that would override their desire to not be alive, but they could hypothetically unlearn the not-falling-off-a-cliff schema before they unlearn the wanting-to-die schema.

Multiple psychedelic-therapy practitioners also believe that judiciously adding 0.5 g dried psilocybin mushrooms to the start of MDMA trips would further improve outcomes [M.G.'s observation and personal communications]. 

Another less durable mechanism in play is fear extinction. Here, a second emotional memory of safety is overlaid upon the first painful memory. Both memories exist and the safe overlay has to be explicitly and repetitively trained for every context where you don't want the stuck emotional memory to activate. Because fear extinction is shallow and fragile, reconsolidation is preferable. Activating and staying present with stuck emotional memories during therapy reliably prioritizes reconsolidation. While you may have to reconsolidate multiple parts of a memory, once you do, the emotional tone of the memory should feel greatly diminished or transformed.

Even if the current scientific grasp of reconsolidation isn't perfect, focusing on strong mismatches proves effective. This might indicate that if reconsolidation isn't what is happening in the brain, the true process is similar.

Dissociation may be an information disconnection between brain regions that psychedelics forcefully reconnect. 

As an example, here is one maximum speed schedule that the author [M.G.] would have done with hindsight: \todo{include what support I should have had}
\textit{Three guided PSIP sessions at the start. Let out neurogenic tremors as much as possible throughout the healing journey and after.
MDMA + 0.5 g dried mushroom session once every 6 weeks. Spend abundant time walking in nature, pondering my past, transcribing recorded MDMA sessions, etc.
30ug LSD sessions twice a week to bring up minor stuck emotional memories that I could process. Eventually the minor stuck emotional memories ran out, and the sessions started going to the major stuck emotional memories, which felt unbearable. I stopped using LSD at that point.}



\section{Body-Scan Meditation}
\label{bodyScan}
The aim of this body scan meditation is to cultivate awareness and identify areas in the body where stress or trauma-related feelings might be stored. This can help in understanding and processing these feelings.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Find a Comfortable Position:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Lying Down:} Lay on a mat or comfortable surface, ensuring your entire body is supported. Place your arms slightly away from the body, palms facing up.
        \item \textbf{Seated:} If you prefer sitting, choose a chair or cushion. Ensure your back is straight, feet are flat on the ground, and hands rest on your lap.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Close Your Eyes:} Begin by taking several deep breaths. As you inhale, feel the air fill your lungs. As you exhale, imagine releasing any immediate tension.
    \item \textbf{Begin at the Feet:} Focus your attention on your toes, then the soles of your feet, progressing to the heels and up to the ankles. Notice any sensations - be it warmth, coolness, tension, tingling, or even numbness. If you sense areas of tension or discomfort that might be related to stress or trauma, acknowledge them without judgment.
    \item \textbf{Progress Upward Slowly:} Move your attention up through the body, section by section – calves, knees, thighs, pelvis, stomach, chest, back, shoulders, arms, hands, neck, face, and the top of your head. At each section, pause for a moment to notice sensations and any feelings of tension or unease.
    \item \textbf{Observe without Judgment:} If you identify areas that seem to hold trauma or stress, simply observe without trying to change, judge, or interpret. Your role is to be an observer, bringing these areas into your conscious awareness.
    \item \textbf{Breathe into Tension:} When you encounter a spot holding tension or trauma feelings, imagine breathing into that area on the inhale and releasing tension on the exhale. This can promote relaxation and release.
    \item \textbf{Complete the Scan:} Once you've observed every section of your body, take a few more deep breaths. Reflect on the experience, acknowledging any insights or sensations you've encountered.
    \item \textbf{Return Slowly:} When you feel ready, wiggle your fingers and toes, bringing movement back to the body. If lying down, turn to one side and push yourself up to a seated position. Open your eyes and take a moment to transition back to your surroundings.
\end{enumerate}
Body scan meditation can bring up intense emotions, especially when focused on trauma. It's important to approach the practice with self-compassion. Remember, this is a tool for awareness and healing, so be gentle with yourself.


This manual starts with an overview of trauma, how the mind and body respond to trauma, and the mechanisms of healing. Then we discuss the outcomes of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy clinical trials, compare MDMA-therapy to other methods, and discuss drug interactions, medical contraindications, psychological risks, common concerns, and dosing. Next we cover session planning and expectations, recommendations for conducting the session, making sense of the session afterwards, continued healing, making positive life-changes, and managing pacing and technique to minimize destabilization. Finally, there is troubleshooting, complementary practices and medicines, and recommended books and tools. \todo{move to abstract?}

Stuck emotional memories and their associated defenses are sometimes called different things based on the intensity of their impact on your life. "Trauma" and "mental illness" are often used for major experiences and "unprocessed emotions", "emotional baggage", "residual stress", "hang-ups", or "emotional triggers" are often used for minor experiences, though this categorization is imprecise. Other than intensity and impact, the distinction between major and minor is not important, as both work in similar ways, have similar negative impacts on your wellbeing, cause similar, often harmful defenses, and should be healed in similar ways. This guide will prefer the term "stuck emotional memory" to avoid the unnecessary connotations of the other terms, and to emphasize the emotional component of the memory rather than the episodic component. "Healing" will be used as a broad term that includes memory reconsolidation, gaining insight, learning of skills, and more.

While not every citation was reviewed, most were carefully selected as valuable resources. We have tried to prioritize freely available sources that don't use unnecessarily technical language, but sometimes rigor or comprehensiveness took precedence. Some references contain both DOI and URL links. The DOI is a stable link to the publisher's webpage for the article. The URL links to a less stable full-text document on another website when the full text isn't available from the publisher.

If any type of trauma therapy is successful and continued until there aren't many stuck emotional memories left, you can expect long-lasting, durable healing of most stuck fears, maladaptive defenses, mental illnesses, and some psychosomatic and stress-aggravated illnesses (some may not be reversible, or only reversible with additional life changes or medical tools). These states may arise again in response to new trauma or old unhealed triggers, but you will now have tools to get unstuck again. If all trauma-therapy is discontinued while you're in a destabilized state, that destabilization has the potential to persist long-term.


In certain contexts, activities like crying, physical activity, yelling, laughter, rituals, singing, talking, or art can also heal, with different activities working for different people \cite{rottenbergCrying}. They reduce a heightened ANS state, enabling calmer exploration of emotional memories. They may also facilitate reconsolidation through bringing the memory into extended focus and increasing mismatch though release of various good-feeling neurochemicals.

 Almost all deaths involving MDMA are caused by heat stroke from dehydration, hot environments, and prolonged dancing \cite{hubermanMDMA}. Heat stroke is not a concertn in typical therapeutic contexts.

 The placebo results are similar to other forms of non-medicine-assisted professionally guided therapy \cite{otaloraMDMA}

 While expert assistance can be invaluable at challenging moments during the healing journey, we won't reiterate this throughout this manual unless there is an exceptional risk.

, especially if others depend on your stability for their basic needs.

 MDMA also has medical contraindications, addressed in Section \ref{sectionSafety}.

    \item Absence of personality disorders, psychotic disorders, mania or depression significant enough to cause hospitalization, or severely impaired impulse control \cite{colemanPsychedelicPsychotherapy}. We think these conditions may be amenable to MDMA healing with expert guidance and an abundance of care and planning.


MDMA is an empathogen, ("generating a state of empathy"), also possessing minor psychedelic ("mind manifesting") properties. 

While some claim supplements can reduce post-session exhaustion, their efficacy isn't well-supported by scientific evidence \cite{hubermanMDMA}.

. A drug's concentration in the blood decreases by half during each half-life period. For example, after one half-life, 50\% of the drug remains; after two half-lives, 25\% remains, and so on. The half-life of MDMA is 8 hours \cite{torrePharmacology}.

 (Hours 0.25 to 0.75)
 (Hours 0.75 to 4)
 (Hours 4 to 6)
 (Hours 5 to 24)

 Although reconsolidation may still occur at a slower pace, you might need to use additional effort to focus on distressing schemas.

    \item \textit{Why Zebras don't get Ulcers} by Robert Sapolsky, Ph.D. Sapolsky discusses how chronic stress affects human health, drawing parallels between humans and other animals. He combines humor and research to provide insights into managing stress \cite{sapolskyZebra}.

The usage and prominence of these defense mechanisms can vary widely based on individual experiences, cultural factors, and personal development. While many of these mechanisms can be healthy in certain contexts, they can become problematic if overused or if they hinder overall emotional growth or understanding. For more thorough coverage see \textit{Why Do I Do That?: Psychological Defense Mechanisms and the Hidden Ways They Shape Our Lives} by Joseph Burgo Ph.D. \cite{burgoDefenseMechanisms,cramerDefenses}.

While defenses are unconscious, people also use conscious methods called coping strategies to manage their distress \cite{lazarusCoping}. These can take a variety of adaptive  and maladaptive forms, such as exercise, drinking alcohol, or avoiding triggering situations.

 R. Coleman's \textit{Psychedelic Psychotherapy} for a wealth of information \cite{colemanPsychedelicPsychotherapy}.

This built on a history of drug prohibition and stigmatization that predates this era. 

        We note that you could add psilocybin, an anti-addictive medicine, at the start of your MDMA session (see Section \ref{sec:dissociationandresistance}) if you feel susceptible \cite{principeAddiction}. It will expose you more directly to distressing repressed emotions and your experience will likely be unpleasant, while likely increasing the depth of healing.

\item \textbf{Psychosis}
        Psychedelics uncommonly trigger temporary psychosis in those with a personal or family history of psychosis or bipolar disorder \cite{schlagPsychedelicAdverseEffects}. We suggest expert guidance may allow safe use of these medicines even with those contraindications. There are almost no recorded incidents of psychedelics inducing psychosis in those without a personal or family history. Psychosis, while strongly affected by genetic and social factors, generally requires triggering by trauma. MDMA is more of an empathogen than a psychedelic, but it also facilitates the surfacing of distressing emotional memories and could conceivably trigger temporary psychosis in those with a personal or family history.

 This could be explained if maladaptive schemas are a necessary (but not necessarily sufficient) component of the large majority of mental illness \cite{vanderKolkBody}. Maladaptive schemas are healed through reconsolidation, and we hypothesize that traditional psychiatric drugs may not assist that process, though appropriate use can help you stabilize in some situations. A variety of psychiatric drugs may also inhibit reconsolidation \cite{laneReconsolidation}.



\textbf{Example schedule \#1 (typical):}
\textit{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Enough PSIP sessions to enable non-medicine-assisted psychogenic tremoring. Guidance may be necessary. Use tremoring as needed when you are outside the therapeutic window or otherwise want to deactivate.
        \item MDMA sessions every 6 weeks. Adjust frequency as you gain experience. A higher frequency may be justified if you are not able to make significant progress without MDMA or if you need to make faster progress to meet various goals.
        \item Coherence therapy every day when you notice maladaptive schemas.
        \item As much journaling, nature walks, body-movement practices, etc. as needed to make sense of how trauma affected you.
    \end{itemize}
}
\noindent \textbf{Example schedule \#2 (max-speed):}
\textit{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Enough PSIP sessions to enable non-medicine-assisted psychogenic tremoring. Guidance may be necessary. Use tremoring as needed when you are outside the therapeutic window or otherwise want to deactivate.
        \item MDMA sessions every 3 weeks to continually stay in a critical period where daily reconsolidation is more effective. Adjust the frequency if your post-MDMA session critical period is more or less than 3 weeks. The safety of MDMA-therapy as this frequency has not been rigorously studied. Some may find this frequency worth doing if they are deeply dysfunctional.
        \item Coherence therapy every day when you notice maladaptive schemas. Keep going until you're exhausted. Adding 5 $\mu$g LSD may help. Small-dose LSD session of 30 $\mu$g up to twice a week may serve a similar role.
        \item As much journaling, nature walks, body-movement practices, etc. as needed to make sense of how trauma affected you.
    \end{itemize}

Because of the dangers of manic and psychotic episodes, we only recommend experimenting with MDMA-therapy for those conditions if existing treatments are inadequate, and then only in the physical presence of a professional with a strong capacity to treat these conditions, understanding of MDMA-therapy, and effective symptom oversight and management (including the ability to prescribe psychiatric medication).

 This method can also ease challenging tasks, like difficult conversations, by associating them with empathy. For this, have such conversations during an MDMA session once you're familiar with the therapy. Make sure to ask for informed consent from your conversation partner.

When it does happen, stress of therapeutic destabilization is likely a major factor in triggering episodes in genetically-susceptible people \cite{winkelPsychosisStress}. 

Further studies investigating more health measures, longer-term MDMA use, larger numbers of participants, or higher-risk populations may discover currently unknown adverse effects.

We think MDMA neurotoxicity is highly unlikely in humans in therapeutic contexts \cite{passieHistory,halpernMormonRavers}. However, MDMA is known to cause oxidative stress in the brain at very high doses in animal tests. This may also happen at sufficiently high doses in humans, though it has not been demonstrated. 

    \item The target issue may involve schemas you don't fully understand or regularly experience. Once the schema is made explicit in therapy, you may not be able to avoid overwhelming feelings in daily life.

    \item Challenging insights about one's past, behavior, or beliefs may provoke difficult emotions.
    
        \item Coping behaviors or beliefs may fall away as inner stability increases, or as a result of insight. This change is usually healthy in the long term, but the lack of a familiar coping pattern may be hard to deal with in the short term.

    \item In the Internal Family Systems framework, some schemas termed "protectors" facilitate emotional stability by pushing us to avoid distressing thoughts or emotions \cite{schwartz2019internal}. Protectors can increase in intensity when the overwhelming feelings they push us to avoid are engaged with during therapy. This is termed protector backlash.
    
    Difficult emotions may become more noticeable as dissociation decreases.
    
    Emotional numbing is a category of mental and/or physiological states we invent to capture anecdotes we have heard of how some people seem to "not feel anything" during MDMA-therapy, but are not always clearly immobile. We are unsure of the nature or validity of this phenomena. It may be some extreme form of avoidance, an atypical form of opioid-mediated defense cascade activation, an opioid-mediated phenomena not in the defense cascade, immobility where the immobility aspect is counteracted by MDMA-induced stimulation, something else, multiple things, or a mistaken category that doesn't actually exist. Here is one example that highlights this category: "People with significant State-4 [a high level of dissociation] may have very little or no response to substances as powerful as MDMA or psilocybin. They will feel sober, or bored or sleepy as if they could get up and go about their day \cite{razviPSIP}." We don't think someone experiencing one of the dissociative defense cascade states of tonic or collapsed immobility would want to "get up and go about their day." This highlights the possibility that there is a category of dissociative state that doesn't match up well with the defense cascade model. Whatever the nature of this category, \textcite{razviPSIP} reports consistent success reducing the dissociation by "...bringing blankness, flat affect, nothingness, boredom, sleepiness, or sobriety into focus." Then, "In a psychedelic-assisted session, it might take staying with it from minutes to a full day-long session, but it will crack." If this category is opioid-mediated, naloxone may help, as mentioned above \cite{escamilla2023treatment}.

These protective factors reduce risk of trauma through a range of mechanisms that improve a person's ability to experience potentially traumatic events in a way that holds a unified meaning for them. That is to say, a person who has many of these factors acting in their support when they experience a potentially traumatic event will be more likely to encode the memory with a single meaning across their somatic, emotional, and narrative/cognitive memory. For instance, a child whose caregiver is explosively violent towards them a single time is likely to carry different meanings of that event in they somatic, emotional, and narrative systems. Somatic systems may recall fear by activating the nervous system when triggers related to the event return. Emotionally, the child may experience anger, but they may instead experience self-doubt or self-blame (especially if they are dependent on the caregiver for survival)--regardless of whether they behaved inappropriately in the slightest. Narratively, the child may remember the events in the same way an outside observer would likely recount them, or they they may not remember them at all, or they may distort the events to amplify their own misbehavior prior to the caregiver violence--in alignment with their emotional memory. If the caregiver in question takes accountability, names what has happened, appolgizes to the child, and takes active observable steps towards preventing future repetitions of the harm, this greatly reduces the child's need to create such dissociated memory and meaning around the event. This is one example of how healthy support from other people can function to reduce the risk of trauma. In general, the protective factors on this list, in one way or another, are likely to similairy reduce risk of dissociation, and therefore risk of pathological truama response.

There are a variety of neural systems activated in the defense cascade, including possibly two opioid systems ($\mu$-opioid and $\kappa$-opioid), each associated with different effects. Different combinations of system activations produce different symptom sets, and these may not always neatly line up with the above list of defense cascade states. Alternatively, this might just be a mild form of immobility. Dissociation is present in a wide variety of psychological disorders. 

\textcite{colcott2024side} published a side-effect meta-analysis of MDMA-therapy trials and found that MDMA therapy "...is associated with greater likelihood of experiencing mild to moderate, but largely transient side effects. Findings, however, need to be interpreted cautiously due to limitations of the existing evidence." The statistically significant side effects included, starting from the most common: dilated pupils, feeling jittery, uncontrolled eye movements, excessive perspiration, chills, blurred vision, jaw clenching/tight jaw, muscle tightness, decreased appetite, restlessness, non-cardiac chest pain/discomfort, feeling cold, and nausea. We are unclear which of these symptoms are due to schema-related defense cascade activation and which are due to MDMA itself. Larger trials would help us better understand rare, potentially more serious, side-effects that haven't appeared in these relatively small trials. Side effects were also measured by spontaneous self-report. Systematic measurement with checklists would likely report more side effects.

 In traditional psychotherapy where mismatch is provided by the client's existing knowledge, this generally does not happen \footnote{There might be rare situations where a healthy schema is unlearned. Someone's deep desire to not be alive might be able to contradict their desire to, say, avoid falling off a cliff because that would cause their death. In that case their not-falling-off-a-cliff schema could be an un-integrated remnant from a time in their life when they did want to be alive.} \todo{cite ecker email on footnote?}, because, a

We are unclear on the exact nature of the mismatch that MDMA provides. However, we suspect it involves intense feelings of compassion and safety in the present moment that feels true and important (Possibly because in all likelihood you really are safe in the moment and your maladaptive schemas usually prevent you from feeling that truth. The same for compassion; you and other beings really do have inherent worth and when we do hurtful things, it's for reasons one can understand.). Compassion and safety contradict the negative expectations or disregard for others or self involved in most maladaptive schemas. Compassion and safety are unlikely to contradict healthy schemas that protect you or others from harm. If this mechanism is correct, it may indicate that conducting MDMA therapy in genuinely unsafe environments could unlearn healthy protective schemas. 

There are a variety of neural systems activated in the defense cascade, including possibly two opioid systems ($\mu$-opioid and $\kappa$-opioid), each associated with different effects. Different combinations of system activations produce different symptom sets, and these may not always neatly line up with the above list of defense cascade states. 

A variety of low-quality studies from the mid-20th century generally reported symptom improvement after administering LSD to individuals with schizophrenia \cite{sapienza2024psychedelics}. We're not sure how this applies to MDMA-therapy.

The contraindications listed here are a best-effort list and may not be comprehensive. We advise always checking with the scientific literature, a doctor, or a pharmacist if you regularly use another medicine, need to use another drug within 24 hours on either side of an MDMA session, or have a potentially relevant health condition. You may need to abstain from some medicines for two weeks before it's safe to use MDMA \cite{malcolmSerotonin,edinoffInteractions}. \todo{emphasize 3 ways to avoid problems}


None of those methods working may be a sign that MDMA doesn't work with your brain chemistry.

    \item MDMA has multiple interactions with the cardiovascular system that create risk for those with some cardiovascular problems \cite{bonsignoreCardio} \footnote{We think Bonsignore doesn't control well for polydrug use and also doesn't take enough caution translating high-dose rodent studies to human therapeutic use. However, we haven't been able to find any better source of information on the topics.}. These risks are further exacerbated by high doses or long-term high-frequency use.


 If you do abuse MDMA, the adverse effects are likely lower than those of most drugs of abuse, possibly because tolerance usually makes abuse self-limiting \cite{nuttDrugHarms}.

 You can also do body scan meditation (Part of Appendix \ref{MBSR} describes this technique) to see if the dissociation feels present in a certain part of your body and send the love there.

You can also try deliberately triggering schemas by looking at photographs or letters, doing a safe activity which triggers the memory, or engaging in a practice that helps you process emotions such as music or art. \todo{Should this really be recommended? It worked for me once but IDK if it's a good strategy in general. If not, also change elsewhere in paper.}

    \item Transitioning to a "whole-food, plant-based" diet for a large risk reduction for many chronic illnesses and significantly reduced environmental impact \cite{WillettEATLancet}. We suggest the Forks over Knives guide \cite{forks}. \todo{impact on mental health} \todo{better way to do this? the guide we cite is triggering}

If your concern is with the pharmaceutical industry's reputation, it may help to know that MDMA-therapy has been successfully used for decades by underground therapists before the clinical trials were started by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) \cite{passieHistory}. MAPS is a hybrid organization with non-profit and public benefit corporation components and donations have provided most of its funding. Also take care to establish the quality of your medicine, possibly using a test kit. \todo{strongman evil drug argument. Example aspirin. Refinement is good. }

        If your concern is with the medicine coming from a lab vs a plant or fungi, consider that those chemical pathways are not fundamentally different \cite{naturalProducts}. Plants and fungi use many of the same chemical reactions used in a lab. Many natural substances are also toxic and cause acute or chronic damage. \todo{not relevant concern. Supplements have a poor track record, chemically isolated medicines do}

 The effects of psychedelics are context-dependent \cite{nardouMDMAPlasticity}.

    \item Two doses of 5 mg/kg on consecutive days may increase long-term anxiety-like behavior in rats \cite{baumannRats}. Doses of 10-20 mg/kg have been shown to cause serotonin system dysfunction in rats. Doses over 25 mg/kg are clearly neurotoxic in rats. We suggest the safe dose limit is far lower than these numbers to account for individual differences and a margin of error. We suggest limiting doses to 120mg plus a 60mg booster, as was used in the clinical trials, as a precaution. \todo{comment on mg/kg vs fixed size} \todo{inaccurate because of injection vs oral}


This section is written assuming some familiarity with the theory and practice of healing maladaptive emotions, beliefs, and behaviors, and managing resistance, destabilization, and autonomic nervous system states. The rest of this manual is written assuming no knowledge of the topic at all. 

\subsubsection{Feeling less motivated} \todo{why did I include this one?}
Some schemas use unhealthy fear to motivate us (e.g. "Devoting all my energy to this project will prove that I'm not a bad person"). Therapy can reconsolidate this fear-based motivating schema before you develop healthier motivation. We suggest further reconsolidation and engagement with the world will reveal and develop healthier motivations.

\item \textbf{Safety Mapping}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Imagine a safe, comforting place. Add multiple vivid sensations to the memory to increase its power.
        \item Set boundaries around triggering items.
    \end{itemize}

        \item Somatic Experiencing: Focuses on noticing and processing bodily sensations \cite{levineSomatic}. \todo{link to details}

Many find Somatic Experiencing, a related technique of tracking and processing bodily sensations, useful, though no high-quality studies have examined it \cite{kuhfußSomatic}. \textit{Healing Trauma, A Pioneering Program for Restoring the Wisdom of Your Body} by Peter Levine Ph.D. is a good resource for further information and techniques \cite{levineSomatic}.

\subsection{*Body-Connection Medicines}
\todo{a bit woo; probably excise}
Low-dose combinations of LSD and THC taken at the same time can produce a good-feeling and powerful body-awareness \cite{colemanPsychedelicPsychotherapy}. M.G reports a positive experience with 10 $\mu$g LSD and 1.5 mg edible THC and no existing tolerance. This can be deeply healing to those who have been perpetually disconnected from their bodies, a common effect of trauma \cite{vanderKolkBody}. These low doses will likely produce a small alteration of consciousness. At these low doses the primary contraindications of LSD are pregnancy, serious liver and kidney diseases, brain disorders, or personal or family history of psychosis or bipolar disorder \cite{schlagPsychedelicAdverseEffects,passiePsycholytic}. The contraindications of THC are psychosis, severe bipolar disorder, severe cardiovascular, immunological, liver, or kidney disease, especially in acute illness \cite{DCCannabis}.

\subsection{Coherence Therapy}
\todo{incorporate technique of intertwined identification and disconfirmation}
Coherence Therapy addresses emotional and behavioral patterns through the lens of schemas \cite{eckerUnlocking}. The goal is to unearth these schemas, confront them with contradictory experiences, and thus facilitate their reconsolidation. Here's a simplified model: \todo{what does coherence mean? why does this make sense?} \todo{make an example and work through it with each technique}

\noindent \textbf{Accessing Sequence:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Symptom Identification: Start by identifying a recurring, unwanted emotional or behavioral reaction or belief that seems involuntary, beyond conscious control.
    \item Identification of Target Schema: Reflect on the origin of this reaction. Consider its past occurrences and try to remember its inception. Documenting your introspection might reveal events or situations that birthed this deep-seated schema. \todo{hard, how make easier? therapist can help. tools (prompts we mention above, thought records)?}
    \item Identification of Disconfirming Knowledge: Choose whether you want to disconfirm the belief or emotional memory component of the schema. One may feel more fundamental than the other and disconfirming it may provide deeper healing. Identify experiences or understandings that challenge or oppose this schema component. \todo{is one really more fundamental}
\end{itemize}
\noindent \textbf{Erasure Sequence:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reactivation of the Target Schema: Activate the target schema, perhaps by reliving related emotions or memories.
    \item Activation of Disconfirming Knowledge, Mismatching the Target Schema: Simultaneously hold in mind both the old truth and the current experiences that challenge it. Feel the tension or contradiction between them. This direct emotional juxtaposition is the essence of Coherence Therapy and serves as the catalyst for the dissolution of the outdated schema. The tension dissipates after minutes to tens of minutes, indicating completion of reconsolidation. Focusing on the physical sensations of the disconfirming experience may increase mismatch since activating multiple aspects (touch, taste, etc.) of a memory make it stronger \cite{brownAttachmentDisturbances,mayerMultimedia}. \todo{thought record}  \todo{is somatic visualization the term for this?}
    \item Repetitions of the Target-Disconfirmation Pairing: Schemas often feel like complex networks of multiple memories, beliefs, emotions, and triggers. The previous step only reconsolidates the portion activated during that session. Repetition is necessary as different triggers activate remaining parts of the network.
\end{itemize}
\noindent \textbf{Verification:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reflective Self-Assessment: Reflect on the initial triggers and schema. Do they feel different now?
    \item Mental Imagery Evaluation: "Visualize situations that previously evoked the initial reaction. Note any changes in your emotional response.
\end{itemize}
For on-the-spot reconsolidation of daily-activated schemas: Recognize the schema, identify opposing experiences, and activate the opposing experience. Memories of profound MDMA experiences can provide a universal mismatch if you can't identify the target schema or a disconfirming experience. \todo{also need to sit with schemas}

Coherence Therapy requires more cognitive effort than MDMA-therapy, but is fundamentally similar. Activation of target schemas and disconfirming experiences (here it is the effects of MDMA) are more automatic and intense in MDMA-therapy, achieving deeper reconsolidation with less effort and thinking. Memories of powerful MDMA experiences can serve as exceptionally effective disconfirming experiences for a range of maladaptive schemas. \todo{talk about lack of critical period for non-psychedelic therapy}

\subsection{Somatic Healing with THC}
\todo{no evidence, probably excise; might be worthwhile to try but may compromise reputation of paper}
\label{psip}
When dissociation is blocking other methods of healing, you can deactivate the ANS and reconsolidate stuck schemas by working through the bodily manifestation of stress \cite{razviPSIP}. First, prepare by spending an hour engaging with your sensations and relaxing your body via deep breathing \todo{an hour may be too hard for some people, a shower, or another method [personal communication with Jessica Sojorne Libere]. Second, a small dose of THC is taken to heighten bodily awareness. Third, locate the stress in your body with body-scan meditation (see Appendix \ref{MBSR}) or a similar technique. When you find it, you can either:} \todo{What does tremoring actually do? Unclear.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Surround the stress with love and compassion until it dissipates, thus reconsolidating the associated memory. This will become easier to do without THC or a guide as you practice.
    \item Shake your body to induce neurogenic tremoring, an important natural process that returns the ANS to a relaxed state \cite{berceliTremor,razviPSIP}. We often unconsciously avoid this because we fear loss of control, associate tremoring with stigma, or are taught to suppress it. Re-engaging with it can permanently reduce dissociation and anxiety if your ANS was stuck in an activated state. The deactivation may be temporary if a maladaptive schema re-triggers the ANS, though tremoring can be used as much as you want to keep deactivating it. Reconsolidation is now possible once dissociation and panic are relaxed, and you regain contact with your body. We have observed that tremoring can become spontaneous when relaxed and can be temporarily halted if needed. If tremoring is not possible, stay present with the dissociation or panic and gently inhibit thoughts, small movements, and comforting impulses (called Selective Inhibition in the Psychedelic Somatic Interactional Psychotherapy (PSIP) model. See Section \ref{selectiveInhibition}). Maintaining Selective Inhibition for tens of minutes will likely start deactivating the ANS and induce tremoring.
\end{enumerate}
We know some can do this on their own, but an experienced guide is required if the THC impairs your executive control. The contraindications of THC are psychosis, severe bipolar disorder, severe cardiovascular, immunological, liver, or kidney disease, especially in acute illness \cite{DCCannabis}.

There is little evidence that even lower sub-perceptual doses called microdosing improve mental health \cite{politoMicrodosing}.

\item \textit{Healing the Fragmented Selves of Trauma Survivors} by Janina Fisher, Ph.D. "...integrates a neurobiologically informed understanding of trauma, dissociation, and attachment with a practical approach to treatment \cite{fisherFragmented}."

\subsection{*Common Maladaptive Schemas}
\todo{Would probably be better as glossary of common language for maladaptive behaviors. Unclear on utility of this section.}
\label{ref:defenses}
All schemas were at some point defensive (protective) \cite{eckerUnlocking}. We suggest some of these overlap with what the psychodynamic framework calls defense mechanisms. Here are some common ones \cite{vaillantAdaptation}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Psychosis} Denial or distortion of external reality. Sometimes involves delusions of persecution.
    
    \item \textbf{Projection} Attributing one's own unacceptable feelings or thoughts to others.
    \item \textbf{Passive-Aggressive Behavior} Expressing hostility or anger in non-assertive ways.
    
    \item \textbf{Intellectualization} A pattern of perceived dispassionate and rational thought that hides distressing emotions. It is similar to rationalization and magical thinking.
    \item \textbf{Repression} General unawareness of emotions, memory, or senses.
    \item \textbf{Displacement} Taking out emotions on people or objects that aren't the actual cause of the issue.
    \item \textbf{Reaction Formation} Behaving in a way that's opposite to one's genuine feelings.
\end{itemize}

*Several other phenomena also explain the behavior of traumatized people \cite{laneReconsolidation}. Partially surfaced schemas push us to excessively focus on related emotional stimuli, a phenomenon known as emotional congruence. Intense emotions also strengthen memory formation, making traumatic memories especially prominent.

MAPS has two MDMA-therapy playlists on Spotify \cite{mapsMusicA,mapsMusicB}.     \item Music is commonly used to evoke distressing emotional memories \cite{mithoeferManual}. We suggest creating art or music may also help you evoke distressing schemas.

Two doses of 5 mg/kg on consecutive days is known to possibly cause long-term side effects in rats \cite{baumannRats}. 

 MDMA-therapy afterglow is less-studied but shares some similarities \cite{sessaAfterglow}.

 Examples include individuals or groups of humans you don't like or don't approve of, the more intelligent non-human animals like great apes, elephants, and octopuses, and less intelligent animals like fish and insects. 

 While starting a session under stress from current events or memories is ok, refrain if you're overly fatigued or unstable. \todo{ask jess} \todo{family history of psychosis is strong indication is strong indication to go cautiously} Consecutive sessions without sufficient recovery amplify the risk of severe side effects like psychosis. You can proceed with a subsequent session even if you haven't fully integrated the insights from the previous one. \todo{self assessment}

Healing is a lifelong practice. The stresses of life may eventually create more stuck schemas, but now you will have more tools to process them.

Heat stroke from intense physical activity and dehydration can also cause brain damage \cite{yeoHeatStroke}.

MDMA benignly increases body temperature by 0.2-0.8$^{\circ}$C or 0.4-1.4$^{\circ}$F \cite{liechti2014effects}. 

4. defense cascade-deactivating techniques such as deep breathing, tremoring, and grounding can be essential to staying within the therapeutic window, and are complementary to MDMA during a session. 

MDMA's biological half life is 8.5 hours, however sessions typically only last 4-8 hours due to rapidly developed tolerance \cite{torrePharmacology,mithoeferManual,vizeliActuteEffects,farreTolerance}. Because of this tolerance, booster doses may not increase the beneficial subjective effects as much as the dose would suggest. We hypothesize that a greater therapeutic effect may be obtained for the same amount of MDMA by reducing dose but increasing session frequency, such that total mg MDMA/month remains constant. For example, instead of using a standard 120mg initial dose + 60mg booster dose once every 6 weeks, a 120mg dose once every 4 weeks may provide greater theraputic benefit on the same overall quantity of medicine. We are not aware of this hypothesis having been tested. This approach may be particularly useful for individuals doing solo MDMA therapy who also have an abundance of time. It may be less useful for expensive professionally guided sessions where it is worthwhile to trade a deeper or slightly extended session (probable 1.5 hour increase) for more recovery post-session. \todo{is this still relevent in light of non-linear dose-response of mdma?} \todo{ask expert who has done study design of mdma}

    \item Obtain reading material from the reading list in Section \ref{resources} if desired.


 If you do take supplements, we suggest a high level of caution when purchasing supplements, as false claims and inaccurate ingredient lists are pervasive in the supplement industry \cite{cohen2023Supplements}.
 
  We agree but also speculate that limited, pre-agreed touch like hand-holding may be ok with providers you have an existing high-trust relationship with. Feeling safe and confident telling the therapist no is also a prerequisite to touch. Saying no could be practiced in an MDMA session prior to actual hand-holding in a subsequent session, allowing the client to soberly reflect on how it felt for them. This should not escalate into any remotely sexual forms of touch. Sexual touch from others is not necessary to heal sexual trauma; only reactivation and mismatching of the relevant schemas is needed.

On the high side, distracting side-effects can start increasing at doses over 120 mg and may overtake desirable effects at doses over 160 mg in the average person \cite{bruntLinking}. 


We think MDMA-therapy is useful for a broad range of cases, but appears most promising in these cases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Professional guidance with possible transition to solo sessions with check-ins for cases resistant to conventional treatment.
    \item Professional guidance with transition to solo sessions with check-ins for individuals who lack the resources for frequent psychotherapy sessions.
    \item Solo use with no professional guidance with the following conditions: 1) lack of access to conventional treatments 2) ability to self-treat and experience destabilization with acceptable consequences 3) inadequate response to, or an inability to use other effective DIY treatments.
\end{itemize}



MDMA-therapy also reduced alcohol addiction among clinical trial participants \cite{nicholasAlcohol}.


We also suggest that MDMA can be overused when an individual wishes to accomplish a great amount of therapy quickly but does not understand the critical need for sufficient sleep between sessions or the quickly-developed tolerance to MDMA in the brain \cite{simon2020sleep,farreTolerance}. 


The indigenous communities who first discovered how to use psychedelic medicines for healing \cite{celidwen2023Indigenous,davisOneRiver}.

Resistance also includes networks of schemas that reinforce each other: Schema A is itself a stimuli for activating schema B. B then reinforces A with a negative stimulus, preventing A from adapting. Sometimes these networks of avoidance and reinforcement become complex and paralyzing. \todo{give examples}

When you feel the emotions and beliefs of the memory, you are feeling the part of that network that activated in response to a particular stimulus. 

We also recommend The MAPS Psychedelic Integration Workbook \cite{integrationHandbook}. \todo{do we?}

CBD also shows weak, preliminary promise for reducing anxiety \cite{skelleyCBD}. We also do not discuss its risks and benefits here.


    \item Some cases of personality disorder are likely treatable with MDMA-therapy \cite{traynorBorderline}. These conditions involve extremely strong resistance, and destabilization during therapy may be intense \cite{razviPSIP}. The process of MDMA-therapy will likely be more difficult and may benefit from additional support if that is accessible.
    
    
Despite effects being dependent on body mass, most data is only available from fixed dose studies. 


The phase III clinical trials found fixed doses consisting of an 80-120 mg initial dose followed by a half-strength supplemental dose administered 1.5-2 hours later were generally effective and safe for medically screened participants \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}.


We suggest practicing loving-kindness meditation for yourself and your dissociation or avoidance (see Appendix \ref{lkmeditation}). The feelings of compassion could ease down dissociation and resistance.



 
 
 
 
 
        
        Safrole harvesting in Southeast Asia often causes large-scale deforestation and species extinction \cite{safroleProduction}. We urge sustainable production that doesn't involve degradation of natural areas. However, we also urge you to not let this knowledge dissuade you from MDMA-therapy, given the importance of connection, care, and mental health. We also believe care for nature (see Section \ref{sec:nature}), and care and compassion for each other and future generations (see Section \ref{sec:circle}) are of paramount importance and were among the primary motivations for this manual. \todo{remove to avoid scaring people off?}
        
        
        MDMA addiction is rare to nonexistent in supportive therapeutic contexts where it has been formally studied \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2,mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial}. 
        
        
    \item When working with a therapist or guide: Your empathy and regard for each other, agreement on goals and methods, and therapist skill with facilitating reconsolidation. These factors impact outcomes more than the choice of therapeutic framework \cite{wampoldCommonFactors}.
    
    No clear statistical connection between recreational MDMA and suicidal ideation has been found, and correlational studies have had mixed results \cite{jonesSuicideAdults,jonesSuicideAdolescents,kimSuicide}. However, i
    
    
    The interactions between MDMA and many drugs remain uncertain, and self-experimentation could lead to unforeseen complications \cite{cohenMDMADrugCombinations,sarparastDrugInteractions}.
    
        \item Interactions with other medications. Ritonavir, opioids, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, stimulants, caffeine, anesthetics, MDMA metabolites or analogs, muscle relaxants, olanzapine, and metoclopramide may be particularly dangerous and occasionally deadly. Discontinuing medications for 5 drug half-lives before the session and restarting it  2 days after the session generally assures a significant amount (only 2\% remains) of the other drug won't be in your body at the same time as a significant amount of MDMA \todo{soso advice, need better}. As with MAOI's, this doesn't prevent all interaction problems. Discussing drug combinations with a doctor or pharmacist may be necessary.
        
            \item Combining bupropion with MDMA extends the therapeutic effects of MDMA by about 1 hour, while reducing heart rate and blood pressure \cite{schmid2015bupropion}. No adverse effects of this combination have been found.


 Caffeine also increases risk at high MDMA doses in rats \cite{vanattouCaffeine}.
 
 
 In a highly supportive setting with medical screening of participants, both phase 3 clinical trials measured no serious or long term adverse effects (among the set of outcomes they looked at) at 6-week spacing for 3 sessions with 180 mg MDMA (combined measure of primary and supplemental doses) \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial,mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}. Higher doses, more frequent sessions, and a greater number of sessions are likely safe, but it's unknown where the limits are and experimentation can be risky. Doing more than three sessions is likely safe but could potentially introduce unknown risks, which should be weighed against potential benefits. It is also possible that participants experienced a set of problems that the study was not capable of detecting.
 
 On a population level, recreational MDMA use leads to acute physical injury far less often than horse riding does, for instance \cite{nutt2009equasy}.
 
 As previously discussed, MDMA therapy commonly accelerates the processes of reconsolidation and therapeutic destabilization, the latter of which can be disruptive when intense or poorly managed.
 
 We only found one case study describing psychosis following a single purported dose. 
 
 Note that this study only investigated those who experienced new, persistent negative symptoms. Most psychedelic users do not experience these.

    \item MDMA-therapy has only been clinically tested at 6-week spacing \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}. There is little data regarding responsible recreational use but what we have has not shown clear long-term cognitive deficits even with a large number of lifetime doses \cite{halpernMormonRavers}. We are not aware of any high-quality investigation of long-term physical problems. It is not known where the limit of safety is, and it is likely different for different people. We can only suggest attempting to balance this unknown risk with the benefits MDMA-therapy brings to your life.
    
    
    
    We suggest wariness of charismatic people selling things, non-scientific mechanisms of action (false claims of scientific support are widespread), cure-all or quick-fix claims, or companies selling proprietary treatments (almost no currently available psychedelics are not under patent protection). 
    
    
    60% of adults experienced childhood trauma; half develop a mental illness in their
life. Symptoms like cognitive distortion, emotional rigidness/insecurity, and impaired compassion increase tribalism, political polarization, and apathy to animal suffering–hobbling our collective capacity to defeat global catastrophic risks. Access to effective care (a crucial support for stopping intergenerational harm) is inadequate for most who need
it. MDMA is a promising treatment, but good training is lacking because MDMA is illegal.
With legalization immanent, our rigorous and accessible guide to MDMA therapy will: 1) Resource therapeutic MDMA users and clinicians 2) Articulate likely mecha- nisms of effectiveness, to inform the development of future therapeutic techniques
This can reduce mental illness by addressing the prevalent, high impact barriers to effective care–increasing collective capacity for collaboration, supporting individuals who end cycles of abuse, and protecting future generations.



\subsubsection{Warning signs of psychosis and mania}
Psychedelic-induced psychosis and mania are rare unless you have a personal or family history. However, if you or someone you know is showing these signs, we suggest helping them access psychiatric care: \todo{finish} Fear of going insane is not itself a symptom of psychosis or mania. 


However, we also feel these kinds or prompts are among the most fruitful tactics for accessing schemas that would be beneficial to reconsolidate.



 \footnote{The neuroplasticity that psychedelics increase is more accurately described as a reopening of neurodevelopmental windows (called critical periods) where certain types of learning are easier. These critical periods are domain specific, so reopening a reconsolidation critical period is not useful for say, language acquisition, and vice-vera. Luckily, psychedelics actually increase metaplasticity, the general ability to reopen any critical period. The context or activity done during the psychedelic session determines which critical period is reopened. This means doing reconsolidation during the session makes reconsolidation easier in the reopened critical period after the session. It also implies that, for example, spending your session learning another language would induce a language-acquisition critical period.}

 We also suggest reading about the Hard Problem of Consciousness from \textcite{hardProblem}. The linked article at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy outlines a variety of theories of consciousness and the challenges each faces.




 The common phrase "MDMA-therapy give you what you need, not what you want" contains significant truth, even if "need to" is seriously under-defined.
 
 
 
 SSRIs have small average effects (or possibly, higher effect sizes for some poorly understood subtypes of depression, and no effect size for other subtypes) in short term use (long term use is poorly studied) while sometimes causing long-term adverse side effects \cite{ciprianiSSRI,bregginWithdrawal}. Long term benzodiazepine use for anxiety has low efficacy and severe side effects such as long term mental impairment that persists after discontinuation \cite{shinfukuBenzo,barkerBenzo}. \todo{Discuss nuances and variety of treatment options? I feel confident that reconsolidation works. How do mental health interventions work? Is exercise effective by itself or is it just an example of a task that requires effort and feels rewarding? We should talk about the fundamental causes if possible. For instance, if the fundamental mechanism of some intervention is just having a task that feels rewarding, then how do we know it will add any benefit on top of MDMA-therapy, which might already feel rewarding?} \todo{why is reconsolidation better than smushing down feelings?}
 
 

You will likely notice activating remnants of the schemas you reconsolidated during the session. These remnants are easier to deal with than the entire network, perhaps because they are smaller or because you now better understand how that particular emotion affected you. Due to the healing that happened on the session, a variety of mechanisms will also surface different maladaptive schemas.




 Studies of other drugs affecting VHD via the same mechanism suggest there is a linear relationship between cumulative doses and VHD risk \cite{corvol2007heart}. Therefore, we think this risk is low for typical use patterns. Assuming the relationship is linear, extrapolating from \textcite{droogmans2007valvular} indicates that 41 cumulative tablets of MDMA will cause a 1\% risk of abnormal signs on an echocardiogram test. We consider this estimate to be low-quality and, even if it was reliable, we are unclear what practical implications this would have for users.
 
 
 
     Combining MDMA with some drugs of abuse may increase the risk of adverse effects, though high quality data is lacking \cite{papaseitInteractions}. There are strong suspicions that the negative long-term effects seen in some MDMA users are actually due to other drugs of abuse, or mixing other drugs of abuse with MDMA \cite{halpernMormonRavers,passieHistory}. The following drugs are correlated with adverse outcomes when combined with MDMA in recreational contexts, though cause and effect remain highly unclear: opioids, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, stimulants, anesthetics, MDMA metabolites or analogs, muscle relaxants, olanzapine, and metoclopramide \cite{cohenMDMADrugCombinations}. If you regularly use any of these drugs, we suggest following the recommendations in the previous paragraph.
     
     
        \item Pursuing the suggestions from \textcite{adayMethodologicalRigor} and \textcite{vanElkMethodology} for designing more rigorous MDMA-therapy trials. Of particular note is blinding, with most participants accurately deducing whether they got MDMA or placebo. Expectancy effects were also high and may have heightened the problems from lack of adequate blinding.
            \item Does R-MDMA increase the benefit/risk ratio in humans, as a rodent study has suggested \cite{curry2018RMDMA}?
    \item What is an optimal mg/kg dosing? What is the safe upper mg/kg limit? What is the minimal effective mg/kg limit?
\item Also gain a better understanding of the frequency of serious adverse effects. The Swiss Psychedelic Side Effects Inventory look promising \cite{caldervalidation}.





There may be multiple mechanisms of action of psycholytic therapy, and these mechanisms' therapeutic relevance has yet to be fully fleshed-out. One mechanism may include psychedelics bringing the contents of your subconscious into conscious awareness by increasing connectivity between typically less-connected brain regions \cite{linguiti2023functional}, generating insight into your issues \cite{letheby2021philosophy}. Psychedelics also increase neural plasticity, making it easier to see things from a different angle or getting out of ruts \cite{nardou2023psychedelics}. 



MDMA primarily creates feelings of safety, love, and connectedness. In this state your resistance schemas naturally relax and allow processing of avoided or dissociated schemas. MDMA-therapy proceeds similarly for most types of trauma, with minor variations to accommodate individual needs \cite{otaloraMDMA}.


Many physical health problems are symptoms of maladaptive schemas, stress, and defense-cascade activation \cite{kozlowskaDefenseCascade,eckerUnlocking}. Among these problems, some are reversible and will disappear when the underlying schema is reconsolidated, like most of the immediate symptoms of hyperarousal and dissociation (See this list from \textcite{cheetahSigns}). Some heath conditions triggered or exacerbated by maladaptive schemas, stress, and defense-cascade activation may not be reversible or may only be partially reversible. \todo{day write}




We think the 2024 generation of frontier models, Claude 3.5 Sonnet or ChatGPT 4o for instance, may be first generation to be broadly useful. However, their usefulness is likely not applicable to every client's particular needs, and they may represent generally low-quality therapy \cite{wang2025evaluating}. If the 2024 models are not working well for your situation we strongly recommend trying again when a new generation of models is released, since LLM's have been demonstrating major yearly gains in functionality in the early 2020's.



We think LSD and psilocybin are potent tools for reducing resistance. \todo{cite} Mixing LSD or psilocybin with MDMA is widely practiced, though poorly studied \cite{zeifmanCo-use}. We suggest starting with very low doses because LSD or psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy are known for deeply challenging experiences. Adding up to 0.5 g dried psilocybe mushrooms at the beginning of the MDMA session reliably decreases resistance. It also increases the intensity and discomfort of the session. Do not take more than 0.5 g unless you are deeply familiar with the combination. See Section \ref{psychedelics} for more information. This combination is common practice in MDMA-therapy, but no studies have been done \cite{colemanPsychedelicPsychotherapy}. Acutely safe co-use is known from recreational contexts \cite{zeifmanCo-use}.



Extreme threats such as lack of attunement from parents, may cause extreme dissociation from bodily sensations, emotional memories, and current feelings, even while the person appears to be functioning and conversing normally. Chronic dissociation is association with trauma in situations of powerlessness \cite{loewensteinDissociation}. \todo{resolve whether fight or flight is deactivated during dissociation; explain how fight or flight can coexist with dissociation}


Recurrent activation of these states contributes to conditions such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, and dissociative disorders \cite{razviPSIP}. PTSD sufferers, for instance, might frequently switch between heightened aroused and dissociative states. Dissociative and panic states can also simultaneously coexist in many cases of depression and anxiety. We suggest understanding the defense cascade enables safer and more effective healing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Awareness and Insight} Recognizing where you might be within the defense cascade can clarify your reactions and behaviors.
    \item \textbf{Self-Regulation} With awareness, employ techniques like deep breathing or mindfulness to transition from heightened arousal to a calmer state.
    \item \textbf{Pacing} Observing your shifts between hyper-arousal (fight/flight) and hypo-arousal (freeze/collapse) can inform the rhythm of therapy, indicating when to proceed or pause. \todo{not quite right}
    \item \textbf{Empathy Towards Self} Acknowledge these reactions as once protective, fostering self-understanding and compassion.
    \item \textbf{Creating a Safe Environment} Prioritize crafting a secure physical and emotional space, potentially setting boundaries in scenarios prone to activating stimuli.
\end{itemize}


 A common cause of mental illness are protective responses to threats experienced during childhood that are originally adaptive, but then stick around into adulthood where they are no longer needed or healthy.




Our minds continually create and update a network of unconscious memory structures called schemas \cite{eckerUnlocking}. Schemas are composed of detailed memories, abstract beliefs, and emotional responses. They form in response to emotionally positive or negative experiences to help guide our behavior when we encounter similar situations in the future. \todo{finish}





This emotional response and the associated episodic memory (a narrative of how events unfolded during a specific event or "episode") then form and combine with abstract beliefs about the world to form durable, unconscious or partly unconscious structures called schemas, or 'parts' (from the Internal Family Systems framework) \cite{laneReconsolidation,lesswrongCoherenceTherapy}. The emotional, episodic, and belief components interact with each other and activating one activates the others. Schemas are originally protective or adaptive (enhances your ability to cope with your environment; see Figure \ref{fig:adaptiveSchema}), but sometimes become maladaptive (inhibits your ability to cope with your environment; see Figure \ref{fig:maladaptiveSchema1}) when they don't adapt to changing conditions due to the above reasons.

*Schemas are stored as networks of neural connections spread across brain regions \cite{eckerUnlocking}. Some networks are complex, composed of multiple traumatic events and activated by a wide variety of stimuli. The stimuli may be singular and obvious like seeing a wasp of the same kind that once stung you, or diffuse and difficult to understand like a mood, thought, or time of day. We are often unaware of our activating stimuli.



In addition to possibly lacking an episodic component, schemas may contain and sustain other signals in the brain, such as chronic pain or feelings in your chest or abdomen. The mind may interpret particularly strong collections of schemas as separate personalities.



Children are easily traumatized because they have very little ability to protect themselves. A wide variety of situations that are not overwhelming to healthy adults are life-threats to children.

We think a track record of successful treatment is also vital. Repeated unproductive attempts at MDMA-therapy, or even a single exceptionally distressing session, may push someone to unfairly discount the possibility that MDMA-therapy can be effective. This guide aims to put distressing sessions into a larger context where the distress or adverse outcome might be an okay part of a long-term healing process, an unnecessary outcome that can be avoided with proper technique, or sign that MDMA isn't the right tool. Another goal is providing best-practices, risk-factors, and troubleshooting information to reduce the likelihood of unproductive sessions.



Unlike most therapeutic modalities, going beyond the therapeutic window into a panic response is rarely a barrier to reconsolidation during an MDMA session. MDMA is also effective at reducing dissociation, however when the dissociation is strong enough it can still be a barrier. It typically presents as sleepiness, feeling bored or sober, or feeling disconnected from emotions. When dissociation impedes the therapeutic process, practicing extended focus meditation toward the dissociation often resolves the issue. A different approach such as Psychedelic Somatic Interactional Psychotherapy (PSIP) may be needed first if dissociation is so intense that the client falls asleep. Resistance or avoidance may also still be present during an MDMA-therapy session and can be worked with by worked with through both standard and novel therapeutic practices. These may include asking the client to practice selective inhibition (see Section \ref{selectiveInhibition}), prompting the client to focus on and stay present with their emotions instead of thinking or ruminating, or asking probing questions about feelings, beliefs, and the events that may have created them.

This reduces dissociation and resistance, and provides a strong mismatch for reconsolidating maladaptive schemas. We based this manual on the schema/reconsolidation framework because of its epistemological foundation in lower-level neuroscience models and our belief that it is a major component of almost all therapeutic change. Schemas are memory structures containing multiple integrated and co-activating components: emotional responses (e.g. fear at the sight of dogs), abstract beliefs (e.g. dogs are dangerous), and episodic memories (e.g. being bitten by a dog as a young child). Minds create schemas to guide us toward beneficial actions and away from harmful ones. Schemas change over time as situations change, or as we grow up and acquire increased capability to cope with challenges. A schema reconsolidates (updates) when relevant stimuli activate it, and your brain detects a mismatch between the emotional responses or beliefs of the activated schema and the current situation (or a second activated schema, as is often used in therapy). Schemas can become maladaptive when prevented from updating by avoidance, resistance, lack of resources, fight-or-flight, or dissociation. They are similar to the parts of Internal Family Systems. In therapy, mismatches are often constructed and held in focus for a duration of time to deliberately rewrite and re-store the schema in a new, durable, and adaptive form. The safety and connection of MDMA create a strong, possibly universal, mismatch that easily reconsolidates most maladaptive schemas.

\item This is usually simple–"sitting on the couch after finding out my friends are throwing a party without me", "Just found out election results", "hiding in my office after gnarly performance review," etc.
\item When there's time I like to be exhaustive with this column, because people are more open to their most compassionate and flexible selves when they feel deeply seen and known. One way to approach this is to start with the self-attunement tool I've adapted from Bren{\'e} Brown, then sort, copy, and paste.
\item As with every column, if a different scale (or a variant of what the column is asking) works better for you, go with that.
\item All the ruminations in the rumination cycle go here. Some good prompt questions are: what does it feel like this situation is saying about your identity or your future? When we select and bold the hot thought from this list–for the most effective thought record, we are looking for the thought that is most avoided, most painful, most dreaded.  We're looking for a kind of "third rail" quality. We're looking for the thought that would be most relieving to learn isn't as true as you thought it was.
\item I like to make this column exhaustive so that people have the experience of casting about for more evidence–preferably repeatedly–and not being able to find it. If you aren't exhaustive with this one, your brain will sometimes think there is more evidence you've left off the list than there actually is, and that helps it dig in.
\item This column does not need to be exhaustive (in fact, better to quit before you quite hit that sense of exhaustion) but you need some. I like the prompt, "are there any ways in which the hot thought is not 100\% true 100\% of the time?"
\item Summarize evidence for, summarize evidence against, combine with a conjunction (and, but, however). Most effective in the own words of the person whose thoughts are being recorded. :)
\item The point of this exercise is not to change feelings, but recording the before and after like this helps people register more strongly the experience of "good things happening by facing the difficult emotions," which builds resilience–especially if repeated over time

For people who experience alexithymia or who would like support in identifying their own emotions, we recommend this self-attunement tool. It consists of a list of emotions (each of which is elaborated on in Bren{\'e} Brown's Atlas of the Heart) and an instruction to rate how strongly one is feeling each of them \cite{brown2021atlas}. It can be helpful to complete this in a spreadsheet and then sort the responses by the number assigned to then intensity with which one is feeling each emotion–which can also be copied and pasted into columns 2 and 3 of the thought record.

Psychedelic-assisted-therapy trials frequently suffer from methodological problems such as especially poor blinding and high researcher bias \cite{adayMethodologicalRigor}. Because the phase 3 trial participants (and their therapists) usually deduced whether or not they had been given MDMA or placebo, the trials were effectively only partially blinded. While this is a major limitation of these types of studies, we don't think it totally disqualifies them as useful sources of evidence. Psychedelic blinding is inherently difficult to account for because of its strong mental effects. Additionally, some trial participants reported intense expectations of good results \cite{powerTrip}. This expectancy effect likely exacerbates the consequences of poor blinding. We suggest \textcite{vanElkMethodology} for a thorough discussion of these problems. We note that placebo treatments can still be useful if the placebo-induced safety and compassion are strong enough to achieve memory reconsolidation. We also suspect MDMA-therapy is more effective than placebo due to its close alignment with the memory reconsolidation mechanism of action. There are also numerous anecdotal reports of inadvertent profound and durable therapeutic improvement in situations where the user was intending a recreational, rather than therapeutic experience.

MDMA may also slightly change recollection of episodic details of emotionally charged memories \cite{dossRecollection}. 

The complexities of forgotten and remembered memories of abuse are strongly debated within psychology, but there are some general guidelines: While the emotional tone of a memory is a reliable indicator of your subjective experience, episodic memory is flexible and amenable to change over time \cite{reynaFuzzyTrace}. The episodic gist (the overarching theme of a remembered event) is also significantly more reliable than episodic details. Trauma can further impair episodic memory formation, sometimes leading to missing or fragmented memories of traumatic events \cite{vanderKolkBody} \todo{really?}. Time passed since the event and the number of times you have recalled the memory also decrease reliability \cite{laneReconsolidation}. Use extra caution with psychedelics, as they can increase mental imagery and feelings of significance \cite{griffithsSignificance,araujoImagery}. Seek independent corroboration of recovered memories if possible. Due to the power of suggestion, therapists and guides should avoid leading questions, suggestive techniques, and undue influence that might inadvertently plant or reinforce unfounded memories of childhood abuse. 

Based on the memory reconsolidation model, we think MDMA-therapy can potentially treat any mental illnesses that in significant-part consists maladaptive schemas and consequent defense-cascade activation \cite{carhart2019rebus,eckerUnlocking}. \textcite{coherenceSymptoms} has a list of symptoms they have found treatable with memory reconsolidation practices. While we think they are reputable, take the list with a grain of salt because it mostly consists of case studies involving single examples. We think most emotional problems and unhelpful reactivity that don't rise to the level of mental-illness are also schema-based. ADHD is a heterogeneous collection of symptoms with multiple causes, not a single well-defined disorder \cite{luoADHDcauses}. Because of this, it is difficult to say whether some subtypes of ADHD might be schema-based and amenable to treatment with MDMA-therapy. The symptoms of certain types of attachment disorders (which are schema-based) also overlap with ADHD symptoms, making the two difficult to distinguish \cite{follan2011discrimination}. Therefore, we suggest MDMA-therapy may be worth trying for those with ADHD, given the possibility of misdiagnosis or a schema-based subtype of ADHD. MDMA-therapy cannot cure autism, which is genetically- and environmentally-determined, but it can treat the anxieties that autistic people often have \cite{taylorAutismEtiology,danforth2018autismMDMA}. MDMA-therapy is effective for durably improving alexithymia and reconsolidating maladaptive schemas in the presence of strong alexithymia, which is often a barrier to reconsolidation \cite{vanSelfExperience}.

Many mental illness have some degree of genetic susceptibility \cite{plomin2016top}. For, instance, psychosis and mania have strong genetic links, but episodes are often triggered or exacerbated by stress \cite{winkelPsychosisStress,Umeoka2021stressmania}. MDMA-therapy cannot change genetic susceptibility, but we think it could resolve schema-based stress exacerbation of strongly genetic mental illnesses.

It is not entirely known which mental illnesses are schema-based or can be addressed by MDMA-therapy. We suspect a large majority have significant schema-based components. MDMA therapy has specifically show preliminary effectiveness for PTSD, dissociation, depression, and functional impairment \cite{greenMeta}. It has also shown preliminary improvement in well-being, excess vigilance, nightmares, avoidance, anxiety, and sleep in those with PTSD \cite{smithSystematic}.

Reconsolidation produces significant, worthwhile, and continuous improvements in particular schemas (and their associated symptoms).

You may experience feelings of intense and spontaneous compassion, connectedness, or love. We speculate these are flashbacks to the MDMA session and will gradually dissipate as the memory is reconsolidated. These increases in compassion almost always have good consequences for you and those around you.


Self-assessment of the severity of your problems is useful for this last item. This is difficult since we are often not explicitly aware of our schemas, but there are some methods. If we had to choose one scale we

\section{Loving-Kindness Meditation for Dissociation}
\label{lkmeditation}
Loving-kindness meditation can be directed towards one's dissociative experiences, fostering compassion and understanding for parts of oneself that disconnect under stress. This compassionate focus helps integrate these dissociative parts, building internal coherence and reducing self-judgment. If you find any of these instructions don't work for you, feel free to modify them in a way that works better. \todo{do this on medicine if youre dissociating}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Find a Quiet Place} Choose a location where you won't be disturbed for around 15-20 minutes. This could be a quiet room, a peaceful outdoor location, or even a calm corner of your house.
    \item \textbf{Choose a Comfortable Position} You can sit cross-legged on the floor, on a cushion, in a chair, or even lay down. Ensure your back is straight or well-supported, you can breath comfortably, and your hands can rest comfortably on your lap or by your side.
    \item \textbf{Close Your Eyes} Shut your eyes gently to minimize external distractions and help you focus inwards.
    \item \textbf{Focus on Your Breath} Take a few deep breaths. Inhale deeply through your nose and exhale through your mouth. This calms the mind and prepares you for the meditation.
    \item \textbf{Recognizing Dissociation} Begin by reflecting on moments when you felt disconnected from your surroundings, your body, or your emotions. Understand that dissociation served as a way for your mind to protect itself from overwhelming situations or feelings.
    \item \textbf{Gratitude for its Service} With each inhaled breath, feel gratitude for this dissociative mechanism. It stepped in during moments of intense distress, attempting to keep you safe by creating distance from the pain. With each exhale, silently express gratitude, thinking “thank you” for its protective intentions.
    \item \textbf{Compassionate Inquiry} As you breathe, gently ask your dissociative part, "What were you shielding me from?" Allow any memories, feelings, or sensations to emerge, welcoming them without judgment.
    \item \textbf{Reassuring the Dissociative Part} Offer words of comfort and acknowledgement. You might internally convey messages like, "I understand why you were there," "I'm safe now," or "You can rest."
    \item \textbf{Visualization} Imagine the dissociative part of you as a gentle veil or mist. With gratitude and understanding, visualize this veil lifting, connecting you back to the present moment and your surroundings.
    \item \textbf{Reconsolidation} If difficult feelings come up, even frustration or disappointment, stay present with them until they reconsolidate.
\end{enumerate}

It's normal to get distracted during the meditation. Whenever you notice your mind wandering, gently bring your focus back to the phrases.

A similar practice can be done in daily life for items other than dissociation. Start with loving-kindness toward yourself, then expand to loved ones, neutral people, difficult people, and finally all beings. Imagine them sitting in front of you and direct this set of phrases toward them: "May you be happy" "May you be safe" "May you be healthy" "May you live with ease." Over time, aim to practice loving-kindness daily or as often as you can to cultivate a heart full of compassion. Remember, the goal of Loving Kindness Meditation is not to achieve a particular state but to cultivate an attitude of goodwill and compassion. The more you practice, the more natural these feelings will become in your daily life. See \textit{Lovingkindness, The Revolutionary Art of Happiness} by Sharon Salzberg for a thorough exploration of the practice \cite{salzbergLovingKindness}. \todo{link to external guide for compassion meditation}



\section{Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction}
\label{MBSR}
This is an introduction to Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) specifically tailored for individuals coping with distressing emotions and reactions, often associated with trauma. By introducing the foundational principles of mindfulness and offering a series of methodical practices—from body awareness exercises to cultivating self-compassion—it nurtures a heightened sense of presence, self-awareness, and emotional regulation. Through these exercises, individuals can develop skills to ground themselves during overwhelming moments, redirect wandering thoughts, and approach distressing feelings with a compassionate lens. MBSR is effective for coping with a wide variety of mental health conditions including stress, trauma, depression, and anxiety \cite{liuMBSR,khouryMBSR}. The body scan meditation part of MBSR may also help you locate schema-specific muscle tenseness. \todo{check that this list accurately represents MBSR}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Understanding Mindfulness} Mindfulness involves deliberately paying attention, non-judgmentally, in the present moment. This approach helps distance oneself from automatic reactions and habitual patterns, often shaped by past traumatic events. \todo{check john kabat plagarization; cite}
    \item \textbf{Body Scan Meditation} Lie down in a comfortable position. Gradually move your attention through different parts of your body, from your toes to your head. Notice sensations without trying to change them. If the attention wanders, non-judgmentally gently bring it back. Go at your own pace.
    \item \textbf{Mindful Breathing} Focus attention on the breath, noticing the sensations of breathing in and out. When the mind wanders, gently return your attention to the breath. If focusing on the breath activates overwhelming schemas, shift attention to another anchor, like the soles of the feet or sounds in the environment.
    \item \textbf{Gentle Yoga and Stretching} Incorporate gentle movements to connect with the body. Always listen to your body and only do what feels comfortable. Remember, it's not about performance but about feeling and connecting with your body.
    \item \textbf{Sitting Meditation} Sit comfortably, with a straight or well-supported back, and make sure you can breath comfortably. Pay attention to the sensations of the breath, or choose another anchor. Notice thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them. If strong emotions or memories arise, ground yourself by feeling your feet on the ground or opening your eyes and focusing on your surroundings.
    \item \textbf{Walking Meditation} Walk slowly and deliberately, being mindful of each step and the sensation of movement and touch. This can be grounding for trauma survivors, as it emphasizes the connection between the body and the earth.
    \item \textbf{Cultivate Self-Compassion} Send wishes of well-being to oneself and others. This helps in healing emotional wounds and replacing negative thought patterns rooted in trauma. \todo{link to compassion meditation instructions}
    \item \textbf{Mindful Everyday Activities} Practice being fully present during routine activities like eating, showering, or driving. This strengthens the habit of mindfulness, making it easier to summon during challenging moments.
    \item \textbf{Group Sharing} Sharing experiences with trusted others can offer validation and support, but ensure it's a safe and understanding environment.
    \item \textbf{Daily Practice} Establishing a routine, even if it's just for a few minutes, helps solidify the skills and reinforces the benefits.

Meditation can produce a wide variety of pleasant, distressing, or strange effects. Some are no more than curiosities, others provide insight into the workings of the mind, and yet others can be harmful. Different contemplative traditions also attach different lessons to these effects or may suggest different paths of meditation to follow or avoid. \textcite{cheetahHouse} provides a non-denominational service for helping meditators understand their difficult meditative experiences and adapt those practices to your needs. We also highly recommend \textcite{treleaven2018trauma}.


    \item \textcite{bailey2023defense} provides an overview of psychological defense mechanisms, a concept from the psychoanalytic branch of psychotherapy. We are skeptical of the evidentiary foundation of psychoanalysis. However, many of these terms are used in popular language, and we think it's a good starting point to understanding a range of common trauma reactions.


    \item[\textbf{Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)}] \textcite{waxenbaum2019ANS} define the ANS as "...component of the peripheral nervous system [as opposed to the central nervous system - the brain] that regulates involuntary physiologic processes including heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, digestion, and sexual arousal."
        \item[\textbf{Abstract Belief}] The schema component that contains abstract understandings of the world. Someone with dog-related trauma may have the abstract belief "dogs are dangerous."
    \item[\textbf{Emotional Response}] The aspect of a schema that captures and retains the emotional charge or significance associated with an event, allowing emotions experienced during the event to be re-experienced when the memory is recalled. To facilitate reconsolidation, the emotional response is juxtaposed with a contradictory emotion.
    \item[\textbf{Episodic Memory}] The aspect of a schema that involves the recollection of a specific event, situation, and experience, including their temporal and spatial contexts. Together with an abstract memory and emotional response, this comprises a schema. Episodic memories can provide a lens with which to focus on specific schemas for reconsolidation.
    \item[\textbf{Therapeutic window}] The zone where you can activate and stay present with maladaptive schemas without being overwhelmed by anxiety or disconnected by dissociation.
\todo{Do we need a glossary when everything is defined within the first 6 pages of chapter 2? People can just go look there.}
\begin{description}
    \item[\textbf{Contraindication}] A specific situation or condition in which a particular treatment, procedure, or drug may not be appropriate in a particular case because it may be especially harmful.
    \item[\textbf{Therapeutic Destabilization}] A state where an individual experiences increased emotional, psychological, or physiological distress, often as a result of confronting or processing traumatic memories or experiences. This can lead to heightened symptoms or new symptoms and requires careful management to ensure the individual's well-being.
    \item[\textbf{Defense Cascade}] This part of the autonomic nervous system initiates a sequential set of physiological and behavioral responses in response to perceived threat or danger. It typically progresses from an initial "alert" response, to more extreme reactions like "fight or flight", "freeze,", or "dissociation," depending on the level and duration of the threat.
    \item[\textbf{Disconfirming Experience}] An experience that undermines and refutes the validity of maladaptive schemas. Disconfirming experiences can accelerate the reconsolidation of maladaptive schemas.
    \item[\textbf{Dissociation}] A disconnection and lack of continuity between thoughts, memories, surroundings, actions, and identity. It's part of the defense cascade that can become activated in situations of threat and powerlessness.
    \item[\textbf{Reconsolidation}] Memory reconsolidation is the neurological process in which a schema (a type of memory) is recalled, modified, then re-stored. The modification starts when there is a mismatch between the schema's prediction ("broccoli is bad") and your current experience ("this broccoli is good!").
    \item[\textbf{Resistance}] A person's actions that inhibit reconsolidation. These may include conscious or unconscious avoidance schemas like drinking alcohol when distressed, escapist habits, addictions, believing "feeling emotions is weakness", declining to connect with or trust supports that are trustworthy and appropriate, fear that healing a schema will hurt you in some way, denial, projection, rationalization, etc.
    \item[\textbf{Suppression}] The conscious effort to control and avoid unwanted thoughts or feelings. This can be healthy and adaptive when used for short periods to maintain practical capacities until facing those feelings is appropriate.
    \item[\textbf{Trauma}] An event or series of events that overwhelms an individual's capacity to cope, often leaving maladaptive schemas and maladaptive coping mechanisms in its wake.
    \item[\textbf{Trauma Therapy}] A specialized, structured process designed to address the emotional, cognitive, and physiological residues of traumatic experiences, helping individuals process distressing memories, reduce trauma-related symptoms, and improve overall functioning.

	\item MDMA-therapy induces a period of post-session neuroplasticity that makes memory reconsolidation easier or more powerful (\textcite{nardouMDMAPlasticity}). Certainty - medium. This relies on a small set of studies by one lab group on mice and extrapolating the applicability of neuroplasticity from one context to another, but matches up with personal experience and some personal reports from other people.

\textcite{nardouMDMAPlasticity} has showed that MDMA increases the capacity for certain types of learning and neuroplasticity, possibly making therapy is easier and more effective \footnote{They only investigated social reward learning in rodents, but we have observed that people commonly report a similarly few-week long period after MDMA-therapy where therapy seems easier, and they feel less mentally ill. We think it's a reasonable extrapolation that MDMA-induced neuroplasticity makes this few-week long period especially useful for additional therapy.}. We are unclear on the extent to which these two conceptions describe the same phenomena, but both describe similar ways in which MDMA could facilitate general reconsolidation. 


    \item Additional reconsolidation may be easier in the few-weeks-long neuroplastic period after the session \cite{nardouMDMAPlasticity}, so we recommend planning to do as much as possible in this window.

Because of that, we suspect that this period of feeling good is what increased neuroplasticity feels like in your particular context. Neuroplasticity likely aids out-of-session reconsolidation. However, while can also feel good in itself, it is a transient phenomena.

**MDMA induces a period (2-4 weeks in mice) of certain types of neuroplasticity \cite{nardouMDMAPlasticity}. We have experienced that between-session reconsolidation exercises are easier during this period. If you want to accelerate healing, we recommend spending more effort on and experimenting with reconsolidation exercises in this period rather than more frequent MDMA use. You may even find that maxing-out your reconsolidation capacity every day will deliver very large amounts of therapeutic progress. Developing the skill of sober reconsolidation can reduce your therapeutic reliance on MDMA and allow reconsolidation in a wide variety of circumstances where MDMA use is not appropriate. When well-developed it also allows faster healing because the safety and logistical considerations of MDMA-therapy are no longer limiting. In the absence of better safety data, waiting to do another session until after the neuroplastic period also increases the margin of safety vs only waiting a few days until you are no longer fatigued.

MDMA induces a period (2-4 weeks in mice) of certain types of neuroplasticity (your brain's ability to adapt) \cite{nardouMDMAPlasticity}. We posit that the neuroplasticity window after an MDMA treatment may offer an extra boost of support in making changes you seek in your life. This period may be context dependent. That is, a therapeutic session may lead to therapy-relevant neuroplasticity, but a recreational session might not. Some people may find that as they reconsolidate schemas and have positive disconfirming experiences, they have less need for compulsive self-soothing over time. They benefit from the therapy not just through reconsolidation, but through the support that the subsequent peace and perspective provide for positive behavioral changes. Sometimes being in a rut is the function of inertia; sometimes it is self protective, and improved regulation or a sense of new experience or perspective can help a person break out of it.



 (mean of 3.6 tablets every week for 6.1 years) However, this is far more MDMA than is used for therapy.

 Additionally, reported effect sizes in psychiatric drug effect sizes have declined over time, possibly due to early trials tending to be of poor quality, publication bias, or changes in the characteristics of people seeking treatment \cite{leuchtDecline}. If the second explanation is correct, then the average person trying MDMA-therapy in 2050 may have significantly less success than the average person in 2025.

 As \textcite{eckerUnlocking} state, "The therapist's stance is one of cooperating with and trusting the client's inherent capability of revising emotional learnings."

 \textbf{What an ethical, skilled, and well-matched therapist or guide can provide}
\noindent \textbf{What degree of professional support is right for you?}



	\item \textbf{Internal Family Systems (IFS):} We have observed many people report IFS working well with MDMA therapy. We also recommend it because it closely aligns with the memory reconsolidation framework \cite{eckerUnlocking}. However, we think you should know that some IFS practitioners believe some mental problems, specifically "unattached burdens" in IFS terminology, are caused by objectively-real malevolent spirits \cite{IFSdemons}.

It treats all problematic or distressing habits, emotional responses, and beliefs as logically consistent with the individual's internal emotional landscape. These maladaptive schemas are deliberately juxtaposed with a contradictory experience from the individual's past to update the individual's emotional landscape to better fit their current context. 

	\item \textbf{Psychedelic Somatic Interactional Psychotherapy (PSIP):} Though rigorous trials have not yet been done, we think this method shows particular promise for reducing panic or dissociation that impede typical therapeutic methods \cite{razviPSIP,ragnhildstveit2023cannabis}. In this method, a small dose of THC or ketamine is used to directly engage with, and process, the hyper or hypo-activated defense cascade. We recommend a paper by \textcite{razviPSIP} and a presentation by \textcite{razviPresentation} for an introduction to the topic. A directory of trained PSIP therapists is maintained by \textcite{psipDirectory}. We recommend it mostly based on popularity of the method in psychedelic therapy, personal experience, and its alignment with the defense cascade.

The previous section on compassion meditation may also be useful here. Tribalism often involves "othering" rival groups that involves discounting their worth. How does it feel to consider that they have just as much intrinsic worth, and fundamentally deserve just as much compassion as your members of group? How does the MDMA shift that discomfort over time?

**If you're a fan of skeptical inquiry, MDMA's safety could very well help you "...think the thought that hurts the most [e.g. What if the other side is right? What if my political/religious/other belief is wrong?] \cite{eliezerCrisis}."


% \chapter{The Expanded Self}
% Some frameworks of psychedelic integration, including those of many indigenous cultures, consider community, interpersonal relationships, the natural world, and existential insights to be essential components of healing process \cite{bathje2022Integration}. \textcite{celidwen2023Indigenous} reports the following as broadly agreed-upon by traditional indigenous practitioners of psychedelic medicine:
% \begin{quotation}
%     Traditional Indigenous medicine is an ethical, ecosystem-protective, and holistic system of medicine that interconnects humans and the environment. A sense of reverence for the planet guides all relationships, as well as a commitment to preserve all life. Traditional Indigenous medicine from a systems and relational perspective prompts insight for compassionate living and awareness of collective care to sustain the wellbeing of the medicines themselves as well as all future generations.
% \end{quotation}
% In these models, these other components may not be described as fundamentally different than what is commonly meant by the self in the Western world. They may actually be described as different aspects of an expanded self. In practice, this might look something like this: During an MDMA-therapy session you experienced compassionate insight into the causes of a maladaptive or harmful behavioral pattern of yours. You sat with the pain of the behavior-causing schema and it dissipated. This experience helped you understand the causes of your behavior and the solution to ending that pattern. In an extended-self model this insight would also be applied to other domains of life. What implications does knowledge of maladaptive schemas have for public policy, the criminal justice system, cultural practices in your community, etc? Another example: During a session you had a deep understanding that you are worth of love and care; your wellbeing is deeply important, no matter what. This understanding persisted into daily life and you feel an ongoing sense of self-worth that you were previously missing. In the expanded-self model this insight would be transferred to others. The wellbeing of all beings is deeply important, including people who have hurt you, animals, and possibly even insects. What does this mean for how you treat them and how the systems you are a part of treat them?

% We present here a few sections that we think are particularly relevant for the expanded-self in a modern world.


% Unconscious avoidance and resistance are powerful obstacles to healing. Incorporating small amounts of psilocybin or LSD into your session can help bring avoided feelings into focus (see Section \ref{sec:dissociationandresistance}). \todo{do they really? revisit polydrug use}


%\section{Psycholytic Therapy}
%\label{psychedelics}
%Small to medium-dose LSD (30-150 $\mu$g, lasting ~10 hours) or psilocybin (3-15 mg, lasting ~5 hours) sessions have a long history of therapeutic use \cite{passiePsycholytic}. This use of psychedelics is differentiated from traditional North American approaches by its lower doses. At these low doses the primary contraindications are pregnancy, serious liver and kidney diseases, some types of brain disorders, or personal or family history of psychosis or bipolar disorder/mania \cite{schlagPsychedelicAdverseEffects,passiePsycholytic}. We also suggest that a history of suicidal ideation indicates support (making a plan with a therapist or guide, using an experienced sitter, and spending time with trusted friends or family) during and after the session. Higher doses increase the risk of overwhelming engagement with distressing emotions. LSD and psilocybin possess anti-addictive properties and are not euphoric enough to pose a risk of psychological addiction \cite{principeAddiction}.
%
%We strongly recommend starting at the lowest end (or lower) of this dose range and only slowly increasing dose session-to-session if you feel like you could benefit from a higher dose. The MDMA session-preparation guidelines discussed earlier are generally applicable to psycholytic therapy as well.
%
%We especially recommend avoiding frequent, high doses of hallucinatory psychedelics. That, along with large amounts of certain types of high-level meditation, sometimes lead to extended psychosis, mania, or other maladaptive states, possibly even in mentally healthy people \cite{ingram2018mastering}.
%
%A wide variety of strange and profound feelings and thoughts are a common effects of psychedelics \cite{yaden2022varieties}. However, people typically interpret these experiences through the lens of their existing belief systems, belief systems they are aware of, and even symbols present in the session environment. These may include religion, metaphysical theories, or cultural tropes such as "psychedelics show the truth behind all things." While some of these thoughts and feelings may be true of our shared reality, we suggest keeping in mind that people interpret these experiences in a wide variety of different and contradictory ways \cite{notalltrue}. Many psychedelic feelings and thoughts are just hallucinations or representations of your mind. Psychedelics are also known to inflate feelings of meaning and not all insight is an accurate map of reality \cite{hartogsohn2018meaning,tulverInsight}. We suggest deliberation and skepticism before deciding whether your own experience either confirms or disconfirms any particular belief. \textcite{suggestibility} goes into depth about how psychedelics and power imbalances can increase suggestibility and decrease critical thinking.




%We think LSD and psilocybin are potent tools for reducing resistance. \todo{cite} Mixing LSD or psilocybin with MDMA is widely practiced, though poorly studied \cite{zeifmanCo-use}. We suggest starting with very low doses because LSD or psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy are known for deeply challenging experiences. Adding up to 0.5 g dried psilocybe mushrooms at the beginning of the MDMA session reliably decreases resistance. It also increases the intensity and discomfort of the session. Do not take more than 0.5 g unless you are deeply familiar with the combination. See Section \ref{psychedelics} for more information. This combination is common practice in MDMA-therapy, but no studies have been done \cite{colemanPsychedelicPsychotherapy}. Acutely safe co-use is known from recreational contexts \cite{zeifmanCo-use}.



%It is often difficult to access activating schemas. We have noticed that walking, other body-movement practices, selective inhibition (see Section \ref{selectiveInhibition}) or a 2.5-5 $\mu$g LSD supplement (see Section \ref{psychedelics}) can help.



	% \item psycholytic therapy (see Section \ref{psychedelics})



%\section{Thought Record}
%%\label{challengingBeliefsWorksheet}
%Some prefer more cognitive preparation before creating a mismatch for reconsolidation. \todo{day write} This may bring implicit schemas into explicit awareness. Some also like it for structure. One popular method is the thought record in Appendix \ref{thoughtRecord}. Resistance often lead us astray when we think about our emotions and beliefs, adding difficulty to the cognitive preparation approach.


\footnote{The organization cited here and throughout this section, Psymposia, is highly controversial within the field. The NYTimes reported: "Despite Psymposia's modest resources, its members have become feared for their ability to use social media to damage reputations and careers, according to more than four dozen academic researchers, clinicians, industry executives, mental health advocates and former Psymposia members who were interviewed for this article. Many asked not to be named for fear of retaliation."\cite{psymposiaFear}}

    \item When, how much, and why do some psychedelics cause short term (days-weeks) cognitive impairment?



    The complete list of these fundamental sources of error is not known, and is likely somewhat different for each person, at least only in the sense that e.g. for one person hunger might weighted slightly higher than in another person. Even if the fundamental sources of error were roughly the same for everyone, the secondary sources of error derived from our infinitely-complex learned schemas are always different. Outside of temporary fulfillment, error for these things may only be completely zeroed-out in certain extraordinary states of mind. We don't know if MDMA-therapy optimizes your schemas according to your existing optimization function, or an MDMA-modified optimization function that includes different fundamental sources (perhaps different weighting of existing sources of error) of prediction error. These may be slightly different for each person, and the infinitely-complex secondary schemas that create behavior (e.g. how to use your legs to walk to where the food is, how to prepare this specific food, etc.) are always different to some degree. 


 In the clinical trials, 30\% (Our own averaging of the two trials) of the MDMA group and 27\% of the placebo group reported suicidal ideation at the start of the study. After the last data point (integrative session 3 of the third MDMA session) available in both trials, 20\% of the MDMA group and 20\% of the placebo group reported suicidal ideation. Events of suicidal behavior or serious ideation during the trials were reported in 6\% of the MDMA group and 8\% of the placebo group. 


 We suggest not calling or texting anyone until you have more experience with MDMA and you know the other person is comfortable talking to you in your altered state. 


 *Different therapeutic frameworks, preferred by different therapists or guides, provide different ways to access target schemas \cite{eckerUnlocking}. In this section we present a minimum usable framework for readers: activate target schema (one may already be activated at the start of your session); stay present with the distress while the schema reconsolidates; repeat. We also discuss how to deal with dissociation and avoidance. 


 %\section{After the Session}
%\label{after}
%*Physical and emotional exhaustion is common and healthy after therapy and reconsolidation. Because MDMA-therapy is so intense, we suggest planning for 1-2 more days of exhaustion post-session. MDMA can also cause a period of headaches, lack of appetite, lack of energy, dry mouth, difficulty concentrating, and jaw clenching \cite{vizeliActuteEffects}. These symptoms are strongly correlated with dose and usually last up to 3 days \cite{liechtiGender}. We suggest plenty of rest and comforting yourself in ways good for you. Ensure your schedule is clear of major commitments or stressors in the days following. \todo{list of good comforting techniques}
%
%Short-term improvements in your target schema or symptom are not very reliable for those with complex trauma. Longer term progress in overall emotional health is much more assured.
%
%Healing is a complexly layered process. As one layer of emotional distress is calmed, other schemas usually activate and/or become more visible. Though initially challenging, consistent reconsolidation will lead to long-term improvement. This cycle is noticeable both in the long-term (months-years) and short-term (the week after a session may feel more volatile than normal). We suggest not judging a session until 1-2 weeks have passed.
%
%*You will experience more time in the mind's relaxed state when maladaptive schemas/parts heal. The Internal Family Systems framework proposes this relaxed state consists of calmness, clarity, curiosity, compassion, confidence, courage, creativity, connectedness, perspective, joy, patience, kindness, equanimity, playfulness, and love \cite{schwartz2019internal}. Periods of dysfunction will remain, but will become less frequent. If the maladaptive schemas are severe, it might take quite a lot of healing to get to the point where anything feels ok. We suggest staying on top of reconsolidation and defense cascade deactivation, and avoiding situations that activate challenging schemas will help (see Section \ref{sectionManagement}).




**If you know you are near the end of the session, we suggest not diving into any additional schemas, though finishing up reconsolidating your current ones is helpful. Surfacing previously unconscious schemas without adequate time to reconsolidate them could result in that schema dominating your post-session life if it strong enough. On the other hand, diving into additional schemas may be beneficial if you can tolerate the distress and want help making your unconscious schemas explicit for post-session reconsolidation.



 \footnote{Most or all behavior is composed of schemas optimized for future fulfillment of some set of fundamental sources of prediction error.}



 "Protector backlash" from the Internal Family Systems framework may describe a similar phenomena \cite{schwartz2019internal}. 


  \footnote{Some of the major genes involved in mental health may function by making individuals more generally sensitive to their environment such that in environments of adversity they function worse than average and are more susceptible to a variety of mental illnesses, but also function better than average in response to healthy environments and childhoods \cite{assary2018gene}.}


  Additional experiments and are often needed to figure out the intermediate steps. 

  We recommend \textcite{evansBlame} for balanced reporting of why the FDA requested Lykos' do another study before reviewing the MDMA drug application again. 

   \textcite{schenberg2024psychedelic} also discusses how the FDA may have rejected the application because 1) the FDA's process is only capable of evaluating the effect of a drug alone, and can't evaluate the combined drug-therapy intervention 2) the FDA advisory committee didn't have the appropriate expertise to evaluate the application.

   The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review reported issues with blinding, high expectations of good results, and lack of long-term cardiovascular data \cite{icerReport}.

While rigorous and highly promising, these studies were organized by a single organization, and a different methodology may show different results. MDMA-therapy with therapists less familiar with MDMA may also be less effective. 

Those with multiple traumatic events or mental illnesses, as is common in early-life trauma, will need a longer time frame and number of sessions to reconsolidate all the schemas they want to address. 

 How much role genes play in each specific mental illness is not settled, but it does appear to vary significantly \cite{assary2018gene}.


 Here is grab-bag list of information we are aware of for particular disorders (Take these with a grain of salt. None of these trials controlled for blinding or used active placebos.):
\begin{itemize}
	\item ADHD is a heterogeneous collection of symptoms with multiple causes, not a single well-defined disorder \cite{luoADHDcauses}. Because of this, it is difficult to say whether some subtypes of ADHD might be schema-based and amenable to treatment with MDMA-therapy. The symptoms of certain types of attachment disorders (clearly schema-based in our opinion) also overlap with ADHD symptoms, making the two difficult to distinguish \cite{follan2011discrimination}.
	\item MDMA-therapy cannot cure autism, which is almost entirely driven by genetics, but it can treat the anxieties that autistic people often have \cite{taylorAutismEtiology,danforth2018autismMDMA}.
	\item MDMA-therapy is effective for durably improving alexithymia (difficulty in identifying and describing emotions) and reconsolidating maladaptive schemas in the presence of strong alexithymia (often a barrier to reconsolidation) \cite{vanSelfExperience}.
\end{itemize}


How much this will resolve the symptoms of any individual's particular problem is unclear, but the above results for PTSD are extremely promising. 


Note that many mental illness symptoms, such as mania and psychosis, are also activated or exacerbated by stress \cite{winkelPsychosisStress,Umeoka2021stressmania}. Reconsolidation could potentially reduce these symptoms if your stress is significantly caused by maladaptive schemas.

 We think of this work as similar to "Where there is no Doctor."


 This might bring up fear of your social group shunning you for having this belief. We think MDMA might be able to reconsolidate this fear if that fear is maladaptive in some way. For instance, truth seeking may be maladaptive if you only have access to one social group, but in reality you may be able to switch to a different social group that is more tolerant of varying beliefs.

     \item \todo{Reevaluate} It may also be possible to use habit mapping (see \ref{habitMapping}) to guide you in crafting optimal support for your neuroplasticity period. For instance, if my after-work scrolling habit is driven by loneliness, I might arrange to volunteer at an animal shelter on certain days, and to have friends call and talk to me on other days–even if it's just for long enough to get myself started on a different self-care activity.




%\section{[unfinished] Using MDMA to Facilitate Connection with Nature, a Fundamental Human Need}
%\label{sec:nature}
%\todo{If you want to improve your ability to do pro nature things: Mushrooms}
%As \textcite{baxterNatureRelatedness} articulated, “In general, research supports the proposition for a basic psychological need for nature relatedness.” They define the “need for nature relatedness” as “a basic human psychological need to feel a secure and pleasant experiential connection to nature in a cognitive, emotional and physical sense.” Additionally, time in nature correlates with small improvements in blood pressure and stress \cite{caoimheGreenspaceOutcomes}. If you have been excluded from the benefits of nature-relatedness and regular nature exposure by your personal life history or access, we suggest therapeutic MDMA may serve as a catalyst for introducing or strengthening this beneficial relationship in your life.
%
%In order to leverage therapeutic MDMA to create a “secure and pleasant experiential connection with nature” we suggest completing an MDMA session in a peaceful natural setting.
%
%To safely get the most from this exercise, consider:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Arranging the presence of a nature-experienced friend who can assist you in finding a good location and staying safe during the session
%    \item Access to support services and utilities, like bathrooms, food, shelter, and medical care
%    \item Your level of experience and prior experiences with the medicine and dosage you will be using
%    \item Physical hazards, like things you could fall off of and things that could fall on you
%    \item Local plants (like poison ivy, thorn bushes, or plants that would be dangerous if ingested)
%    \item Local wildlife and its likelihood of interacting with your specific location (many snakes like rocky areas near water, bears and rodents can be attracted to food, areas with higher human traffic tend to see less wildlife etc.)
%    \item Insects and other bugs-in the US, especially ticks and mosquitos
%    \item Additional precautions to avoid other humans and maintain legal safety
%    \item Weather appropriate food, water, gear, first aid supplies, and shelter
%\end{itemize}
%
%Although this list may appear daunting, most nature-experienced individuals are accustomed to taking these things into account continuously. Securing a location that takes all these items into consideration may be as simple as arranging to use the backyard of a friend who lives in the countryside or the woods, or having a friend who understands what you are looking for recommend a preferred campsite.
%
%During the actual session, engage all your senses— touch soil with your bare feet, study plants and insects, and feel bark textures. Using psilocybin or ayahuasca can deepen the nature connection and promote permanent increases in feelings of nature-connectedness \cite{forstmannPsilocybinNature}. We suggest caution if you suspect you have major unresolved trauma as it might resurface.
%
%According to \textcite{baxterNatureRelatedness}, increased cognitive and emotional attachment to a specific natural environment “will create a feeling of security and belonging with respect to that particular environment and lead to greater identification with that environment. This, ultimately, will lead a person to feel safer within that environment, which will ease the ability of that environment to elicit the positive effects for the person's psychological well-being.” As such, we posit that further explorations of one's therapeutic target environment can increase the positive effects of this intervention-and that such explorations may not need to be exclusively physical. The nature relatedness of Baxter and Pelletier has a strong cognitive component, and thoughts and feelings about belonging and familiarity are important to their model of how psychological benefits of nature-relatedness are realized. As such, we posit that additional emotional and intellectual explorations of the complexities of nature and our mutually integrated place in it (during or between therapeutic MDMA sessions) are promising as an additional mode of maximizing these benefits.
%
%Repeated experiences in the same natural environment will generate a cognitive and emotional attachment to that area and a stronger sense of place. For example, children who are reared with natural areas readily available may grow up to be more nature connected later in life \cite{windhorst2015growing}. The repeated exploration of a specific natural environment will generate a set of experiences and cognitive representations of the environment that will create a feeling of security and belonging with respect to that particular environment and lead to greater identification with that environment. This, ultimately, will lead a person to feel safer within that environment, which will ease the ability of that environment to elicit the positive effects for the person's psychological well-being.

%\section{Associate Love and Empathy with Cues for Later Recall}
%In this section we speculate that it's possible and useful to associate the positive emotions generated by MDMA with cues, and then later use those cues to recall those emotions in daily life. We don't know of any research on this particular application of cueing/classical conditioning, but the underlaying research on classical conditioning is well established, and we think this particular application is plausible. This may be a productive topic for experimental research.
%
%Revisiting feelings of love, empathy, and safety (such as those experienced during MDMA therapy) can be beneficial in daily life. We think it may help you resolve conflict, enhance interpersonal communication, help you say things you wish you had the courage to say, enhance reconsolidation of distressing schemas, support the cultivation of difficult but healthy habits, or simply help you achieve calm and perspective in moments where those things are needed.
%
%It is possible to enhance your recall of these positive emotions by associating them with one or more specific cues while they are occurring, and then invoking those cues at later times when improved recall of positive emotions is desired. For instance, you might carry a vial of perfume or essential oil, and pull it out to enjoy the scent whenever you are feeling particularly compassionate, loved, or connected to your most positive identities and relationships. MDMA therapy should typically offer an extraordinarily potent opportunity to connect your chosen cue to these positive emotions. Compassion meditation may also offer excellent opportunities. When your cue is associated with positive emotions or “charged,” you can then revisit the scent and the positive memories you have associated with it in those moments when you feel it would be most helpful to ground yourself.
%
%In theory, association and recall should improve as you add more simultaneous cues \todo{Cite}-so if you find this strategy appealing, you may wish to ritualize a variety of simultaneous cues to maximize your access to this tactic. Here are some possibilities. This list prioritizes suggestions that are portable/easy to invoke in many diverse situations (like the flavor of an energy bar or a piece of fruit) or cues that may already be associated with transitioning into a state of mindfulness or positive emotions, like herbal tea. Note that to effectively be used for this strategy, you'll want a cue that you can reserve for this:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item \textbf{Olfactory}: essential oils, fruit or other food, incense, personal care products, a particular tea or coffee drink
%    \item \textbf{Auditory:} music, a bell or chime, or a sound you can make with your own voice or body 
%    \item \textbf{Visual:} a piece of art, a picture of loved ones, an image that symbolizes a beloved identity or occupation, an item from nature
%    \item \textbf{Tactile:} a fidget toy, a heavy piece of jewelry, a textile with a pleasing texture, faux fur, a massage technique, play-dough or similar
%    \item \textbf{Taste:} hard candy, fruit or other food, gum, a particular energy bar or granola bar, your favorite mocktail, a particular tea or coffee drink
%    \item \textbf{Spatial:} your home or bedroom, a favorite place in nature, a place where you often feel connected with loved ones, a place of spiritual significance to you
%    \item \textbf{Temporal:} if there is a time of day when you usually feel good, you may wish to routinely invoke your cue/s at that time for an added boost and an added “charge” to your cues. Also, consider using holidays or happy gatherings as charging opportunities
%    \item \textbf{Proprioceptive and kinesthetic:} specific yoga postures or dance moves; tracing a word or phrase that is meaningful to you with a finger on your skin; self-massage; drawing a particular shape on a chalkboard or in the air in front of you
%    \item \textbf{Conceptual:} read a favorite conceptually important poem, passage, lyric, mantra, or similar. For example, the mantra, “I am becoming consistently capable of lovingly attentive behavior towards myself.”
%\end{itemize}
%
%One example of a multi-cue grounding ritual would be to listen to a particular piece of music while massaging a particular lotion or massage oil into your skin-combining tactile, auditory, and possibly olfactory and conceptual cues.
%
%It may be important to only engage in such a ritual during a part of an MDMA session where you are suffused with positive emotions, rather than a part of an MDMA session where you are focused on processing distressing or traumatic experiences. Note that a cue (or a ritual which conglomerates several cues) must remain “charged” to stay effective because your brain learns that the cue is no longer associated with the original emotional stimulus. If you invoke your cues in distressing situations many times without continuing to build and maintain their association with positive experiences, they will eventually become neutral to you, and then associated with distress. As such, it is important to “re-charge” your cues at a level commensurate with the stress you put on them, in order to continue effectively using this strategy.

  Some degree of liver function must be necessary to metabolize the drug, but there is at least one case study of a patient with advanced liver cirrhosis undergoing cautious, medically-supervised, and effective MDMA-therapy with no adverse effects.


  \item Psychotic episodes induced by therapeutic doses of MDMA without confounding factors are rare \cite{arnovitzSchizophrenia}. One participant out of 174 in the phase III clinical trials reported a psychotic episode (after the trial ended) even though participants with any known personal history of psychotic disorders were excluded from participation \cite{powerTrip,smithSystematic,mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}. Those with family history were not excluded. Published case reports of psychosis following recreational MDMA-ingestion almost always involved confounding factors like co-use of other psychoactive drugs, lack of verification of MDMA ingestion, dehydration, extreme doses, or extreme frequency of use \cite{mcguirePsychosis,patelPsychosis,vaivaPsychosis}. Even if the risk of MDMA-induced psychosis is very low, the consequences of psychosis can be high. Because of this, we suggest that a personal history (or a family history for those with lower risk thresholds) of psychosis is a strong indication to work with a group of professionals who thoroughly understand both psychosis and MDMA. One survey of experts in psychosis and psychedelics reported consensus on psychedelic therapy for psychosis being worth investigating, but that clients should have especially high in-session and post-session support \cite{la2022Psychosis}. We have personally heard of two cases of temporary psychosis triggered by a high-dose psilocybin trip conducted the day after an MDMA-therapy session. This suggests a lack of adequate recuperation between sessions is a major risk factor.

    \item Mania is a dangerous condition that could also conceivably be exacerbated through therapeutic destabilization, though we are not aware of any good data on actual risk. The exclusion criteria for the MDMA-therapy clinical trials may offer some preliminary guidelines: individuals with bipolar I were excluded but those with bipolar II were not \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}. We think a personal history (or family history for those with lower risk tolerance) of problematic mania is a strong indication to work with a team of trusted professionals who understand both mania and MDMA. As with psychosis, we think individuals should have especially high in-session and post-session support.

 Balancing the rarity of case reports of MDMA-induced suicidal ideation, mania, and psychosis with expert-recommended caution probably boils down to individual circumstances and risk tolerance.


  It may also on occasion exacerbate dangerous symptoms like psychosis, mania, or suicidal ideation.

  , and seems to rely on 1) old and incorrect beliefs that psychedelic states imitate psychosis, which is even less relevant to MDMA, which rarely induces hallucinations, 2) focusing on a small number of case studies of psychedelics triggering these conditions, and 3) reasonable extrapolation of the established phenomena of psychedelic therapy inducing psychological destabilization to the exacerbation of these conditions

  The book is essentially my attempt to cope with a dangerous and uncertain world where no-one loves me through rigorously understanding everything and "saving" everyone so that I will be safe. Despite that neurotic motivation, reviewers seem to like the book and don't think I have projected my issues onto it too much.

   %Further complicating matters, a court has issued a restraining order against Sasha Sisko, the individual who requested the retractions, for a series of incidents allegedly involving stalking, harassment, publication of sexual photographs of a minor, manipulative behavior, and lying. While this doesn't disquality the retractions, it does introduce uncertaintly about the truth or appropriate weighting of the reasons for retraction.

   If you haven't had a powerful experience of profound, universal safety, context-specific mismatches will have to be found for each maladaptive schema. \todo{Can we cite Bruce Ecker personal communication?} It may take some effort to find contradictory knowledge or memories of contradictory experiences, but when found, that memory can also be recalled for in-the-moment reconsolidation of specific schemas. We also suspect, based on one case report, that highly-skilled compassion meditation can be directed toward distressing schemas to contradict them.

We also propose that powerful experiences of total safety during a session can later act as a compass you can compare all other experiences to, to deduce if a certain feeling is maladaptive or not. As with real compasses it only measures the direction in which to travel; it can't tell you how far away the destination (reaching particular therapeutic goals) is.

\chapter{Self-Written Case Report of Internalized MDMA Therapy}
\label{casereport}
we include Mark Groeneveld's self-reported experience with this phenomenon as a first step in :
\begin{quotation}
    My first MDMA session (none of the latter sessions were like this) consisted of seemingly-perfect safety and all-encompassing compassion. I comprehended how everyone's maladaptive reactions were due to a variety of learned, no-longer-helpful fears. I also felt that I had a well of inviolable safety inside me so strong I thought I would feel ok (representing emotional resilience, not a lack of empathy) inside even if watched everyone and everything I had ever loved burn to ash in front of me. There was a certain week, after perhaps 10 sessions over two years, when I went walking to deliberately feel my anxiety. At that particular time it felt very good to feel my anxiety for some reason I no longer clearly recall. It was exhausting, and I needed to lay in bed for quite a while afterward to recover. Later I identified this exhaustion as therapy-hangover. That week of walking-reconsolidation is the earliest example I recall of reconsolidation that just "happened" with no deliberate effort or conscious control on my part.
    
    A year or so later after about session 20, I read \cite{lesswrongCoherenceTherapy} describing the process of coherence therapy and wanted to try the process on myself. I thought my first MDMA experience of a well of inviolable safety was the obvious choice for a mismatch for my fear schemas. I activated that knowledge by imagining laying under the tree I was under that first time, how the grass felt on my feel, how the tree trunk felt in my hands. That multisensory visualization seemed to do the trick and activated the well-of-inviolable-safety knowledge strongly enough to start the reconsolidation process. I don't quite recall, but this may have only worked in the two weeks following an MDMA session. It might have taken another 5 MDMA sessions to extend the process past two weeks, at which point I stopped MDMA-therapy as it seemed redundant, and I had some in-hindsight overblown fears about side effects.

    My mental illness was quite bad, so I was anxious to do however much reconsolidation was necessary to fix my issues in as short a time as possible. I spent a couple of hundred hours doing coherence therapy with this knowledge of inviolable safety, which seemed to be powerful enough to reconsolidate any maladaptive schema, just like MDMA. I was limited to two hours a day by therapy-hangover. Eventually I had practiced this process so much that I no longer had to explicitly recall that knowledge of inviolable safety to reconsolidate a maladaptive schema. Any time I noticed a distressing schema I could just “flip a switch” in my mind and start the reconsolidation process. This practice didn't seem to be limited by the typical window of tolerance either; it worked equally well during dissociation and near-overwhelming anxiety.

    Then after a further 300 hours of that, reconsolidation seems to have started happening without conscious intent whenever a maladaptive schema is strongly activated, and I'm not actively avoiding it. It can happen when I'm watching TV, talking to people, or any number of other activities. I can tell when it's happening, but if I'm sufficiently distracted I might not notice. The reconsolidation process seems to be activated by fear; the more afraid I am the higher the intensity of reconsolidation. If I want to turn up the intensity of reconsolidation I can also still deliberately "flip the switch."

    So far I've done about 1100 hours of reconsolidation over the past 2 years. It's made a lot of progress working through my backlog of maladaptive schemas, and I'm much less neurotic than when I started. I started with a truly vast amount of maladaptive fears though, so I have a lot to work through still. It's been incredibly convenient for doing extremely large amounts of therapy without needing a therapist, MDMA, or the overhead of doing an explicit process of understanding my maladaptive schemas, figuring out a mismatch for each one, and then setting up the juxtaposition. It's kept me making therapeutic progress through periods of despair and depression where I surely wouldn't have had the capacity for any sort of typical therapy.

    The only downside I have noticed is that since I have multiple deep maladaptive fears activated virtually every waking moment (I think this is an effect of having virtually zero early childhood attachment), the auto-reconsolidation also starts running every morning once I wake up enough. That inevitably leads to therapy-hangover a bit later. Then the auto-reconsolidation starts up again once the therapy-hangover wears off. I've been therapy hungover a majority of my waking hours for the past two years. I also haven't discovered any way to turn the auto-reconsolidation process off. It goes for about 2 hours a day, limited only by therapy-hangover. Other than "flipping the switch" to increase reconsolidation intensity, the only control I seem to have over the process is that more strongly activating (triggering myself) a certain schema causes auto-reconsolidation to preferential reconsolidate that schema over my other activated maladaptive schemas. This has been unsettling, but I haven't noticed any unambiguous side effects yet other than therapy-hangover, with one exception.

    One day, at the point in this process where I had done maybe 600 hours of reconsolidation, I was riding my bicycle and suddenly felt my sense of self dissolve. My thoughts, awareness, and the external world all felt part of the same unitive experience, no longer divided into self and not-self. This wasn't a dissociative experience, I was still deeply in touch with "my" body, emotions, and sensory experience, and could function appropriately. It seemed like a classic experience of non-dual awareness. The effects waxed and waned over a few months, and brought up a lot of distress about clearly seeing my sense of self as an impermanent construction of my mind, more directly confronting the fact of my eventual death, and a variety of other uncomfortable realizations. Luckily, my auto-reconsolidation process successfully reconsolidated all that distress too. The sense of self settled into a stable, possibly diminished state that became a new and unremarkable normal that doesn't seem accompanied by any dysfunction. Looking back, the event seems like an uncomfortable bump on the road, with neither the old nor new state obviously better than the other. However, that ambivalence might arise from an inability to compare the two stable states, separated by many months, side-by-side. In any case, the auto-reconsolidation capacity seems valuable enough to have made the distress of this experience easily worth it in the long run for me.

    That experience makes me think the initial inviolable-well-of-safety experience was at least partially a non-dual experience, thought it didn't feel like my sense of self was dissolving at the time. I suspect that experience became deeply internalized because it accurately predicted reality in some way. As \textcite{ecker2015misunderstood} stated: "When two mutually contradictory schemas are juxtaposed consciously, the schema that more comprehensively or credibly models reality, and therefore more usefully predicts how the world will behave, reveals the other schema to be false, and the falsified one is immediately transformed [reconsolidated] accordingly." So presumably, inviolable-well-of-inner-safety, while not necessarily representing absolute truth, is more true (at least in the context of my personal lived experience) than my previous set of beliefs that did not include an inviolable well of inner safety. I don't have any metaphysical, ontological, or epistemological insight as to what this means. I also want to note that the initial experience didn't seem sufficient on its own to destabilize my sense of self. That seems to have required re-activating that knowledge for ~600 hours.

    Around hour 1100 I decided to try MDMA again. I was in a particularly tough place and was wondering if I had been wrong about MDMA being redundant with auto-reconsolidation. The session went well. It felt easier to clearly notice what maladaptive schemas were activated, and I have a general, though vague, sense that it added a decent amount of therapeutic efficiency to my regular process. I plan to do it again.

We don't know how well MG's experience reflects the experiences of the few other individuals we have heard about who can do some degree of internalized MDMA therapy. We also don't know if they are correctly interpreting their experience. The process they went through has similarities to intensive insight meditation \cite{ingram2018mastering}. See \ref{selfinsight} for resources on managing this process if you do destabilize your sense of self.

If MG's experience is representative of the phenomenon, the reconsolidation process might simplify down to this sequence in the initial stages:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Notice current distress (fear, anger, sadness, etc.) that isn't obviously situationally-appropriate
    \item Co-activate universal contradictory knowledge
    \item Repeat pairing
    \item Observe markers of target learning nullification. You might not need to continue this step once you've established that the method reliably works.
\end{enumerate}
In the latter stages there are essentially no steps in the sequence because the process no longer depends on deliberate control. The most control they report they have of the process is changing their environment to more strongly activate certain target schemas, which auto-reconsolidation then preferentially reconsolidates.

	\item One trial found that the Therabot AI therapist improves mental health \cite{llmTherapist}. Note that one PubPeer comment claims methodological errors in the study significantly lower the reported effect size \cite{pubpeertherabot}.

**There are multiple practical objectives in healing. Keeping these balanced determines the pace and methods of healing: \todo{Rehome this list?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Healing as soon as possible to minimize suffering and improve function.
    \item Healing that is durable rather than fragile.
    \item Developing skills to process future maladaptive schemas.
    \item Avoiding major disruptions to your life from therapeutic destabilization or other adverse medical and psychological effects.
    \item Minimizing cost.
\end{itemize}

**We know of several anecdotes (including MG's personal experience) indicating that reminders (e.g. music listened to during the session) of the MDMA session can sometimes re-activate the reconsolidation-potential of the MDMA session without MDMA \cite{simmering}.

	\label{def:ipf}
    \item \textbf{Ideal Parent Figure Method:} \todo{}

**We have observed that significant amounts of reconsolidation often seem to happen without deliberate effort in the weeks and months following a session. We speculate this phenomenon may occur when the session destabilizes an attractor state enough to allow natural, gradual shifts of schemas over time \cite{hayes2020complex}.

**Based on MG's experience, we speculate that there is a daily mismatch limit (one date point suggests about 2 hours). At that point, reconsolidation exhaustion inhibits the practice. Sleep (or possibly just a sufficient length of time) seems to rejuvenate the ability. Reconsolidating to your limit every day will likely maximize your progress if you have the time and energy.

In addition to the explicit process of maladaptive schema investigation detail in Section \ref{uncovering}, we think any defense cascade activation (see Section \ref{sec:signsofdc} for symptoms) or non-useful fear, anger, anxiety, etc. in daily life outside immediately dangerous situations is a valuable indicator of maladaptive schemas. Furthermore, we pervasively practice subtle, barely-noticeable avoidance around a wide swath of uncomfortable ideas, places, people, etc. We think noticing and going toward the object of avoidance is usually a fruitful endeavor.

Note that long term use of benzodiazepines is addictive, ineffective (because of tolerance), and causes long-term cognitive impairment that persists even after discontinuation \cite{barkerBenzo}.

In our experience LLMs also output garbage information on therapy in general because the existing corpus of knowledge about therapy in large part consists of a wide variety of a-mechanistic and conflicting therapy frameworks that each have their own language.

   \item MDMA may on rare occasion provoke destabilizing shifts to one's sense of self or beliefs about existence.

    \item Not much is known about when MDMA-therapy will make dangerous symptoms like psychosis and suicidal ideation better or worse. See \ref{sec:safety} for more information.


%Observations (summarized by \textcite{fedduciaMDMAMemoryReconsolidation}, and additionally our own observations of trip reports) of post-session reports and MG's personal experience frequently match up with the signs (emotional non-reactivation, symptom cessation, and effortless permanence \cite{eckerUnlocking}) of a successfully reconsolidated schema. %MG's personal experience and our observation of trip reports also indicate that once a maladaptive schema is emotionally activated and non-avoidance is practiced, MDMA permanently dissolves it without any further effort. It remains unknown what particular source(s) of information provide the mismatch, or by what, if any, mechanisms MDMA facilitates reconsolidation other than safety and empathy.

, or it at least some phenomena that operates in roughly the same way and produces similar outcomes.

Frankly, it is not possible to do psychedelic therapy, or any type of therapy, without relying on someone's varyingly-informed opinions. We think MDMA-therapy shows a lot of promise and want to provide a manual with a lot of provisional elements, because the heat death of the universe will arrive before every little nuance has been rigorously studied.

If you feel uncomfortable assuming the resistance is maladaptive, you can approach the truth of the schema's beliefs or emotional responses with agnosticism, "It may or may not be true or helpful; I will stay present with the feeling to learn why the schema exists and how it influences me." If you can't focus on the resistance schema and another schema is taking precedence, that's ok. You can revisit the resistance later.

In our experience, your thoughts are also a reliable indicator of where in the reconsolidation process you are. Your thoughts often revolve around strongly activated schemas. For example, if your schema involves fear and a belief that you're dying, you may find your thoughts saying things like "I'm dying", "I'm afraid", "Death is horrible", "How could that person be comfortable with the thought of eventual death?", "Hospice facilities are scary", etc. Those thoughts will likely feel compelling. When reconsolidation finishes, those thoughts become less compelling or may shift into compassion for yourself or others. You can watch as your beliefs shift too. During a PTSD schema activation, you may believe, to some extent (often vocalized in your inner monologue), for example, that you're being attacked. As that schema reconsolidates, you can see how that belief dissolves, and you realize you're not actually being attacked. Sometimes our beliefs may stay the same while the emotional valence (positive, neutral, or negative) shifts. For example, you may have had anxiety about the thought of dying later in life. After reconsolidation, you still know you will die, but it will no longer be distressing \footnote{It could also be that the belief that feels like it stayed the same is not the schema you actually reconsolidated. It might be that a second, unnoticed schema, like "death is bad" was reconsolidated and that belief actually dissipated.}.

	\item Metacognitive perspective / therapeutic de-centering; all maladaptive schemas might be clearly seen as incorrect or no long contextually appropriate

the phase II long term follow-up study showed preliminary evidence that the effects are durable \cite{jeromeMDMALongTerm}.
 Long term (1 year) follow up has only been conducted with 103 individuals and no study can investigate all possible health effects \cite{jeromeMDMALongTerm}.

% Refer to \textit{The PSIP model. An introduction to a novel method of therapy: Psychedelic Somatic Interactional Psychotherapy} for one view of the role of the defense cascade in psychedelic therapy \cite{razviPSIP}.

Even worse, there is so little rigorous evidence on inpatient hospitalization that it's not clear it actually reduces suicide rates in the long run \cite{borecky2019reweighing}.

This book primarily focuses on the "psycho" part of "biopsychosocial," with secondary focus on the "social."


Symptom worsening may often be a sign of impending improvement, especially given further reconsolidation \cite{complex}. \textcite{complex} reports "Critical fluctuations and critical slowing have been well-documented to herald transition across a number of systems in nature...," but "Too few studies have been conducted on early warning signals in psychotherapy to draw firm conclusions, but the findings thus far suggest that nonlinear and discontinuous changes and periods of rising variability in symptoms and patterns of pathology occur in psychotherapy, and that these fluctuations predict symptom reduction and the development of more healthy patterns of functioning."

In reality it seems like therapy is often more complicated than a simple transition from one maladaptive state to one adaptive state. 

Therapeutic destabilization can make things feel or be worse at times \cite{olthofDestabilization}, and reconsolidation may only yield visible results at unforeseen turning points as the network of schemas shifts in complicated ways. Furthermore, we think more reconsolidation is the only durable way through destabilization. This claim needs more justification, especially since we are asking you to do more of they type of thing that may have destabilized you in the first place. The literature on destabilization is unfortunately poor.

Destabilization may also consist of simply activating previously-dissociated or avoided memories. This may be overwhelming, or may activate debilitating defense cascade states.

We think another complexity, destabilization (psychological turbulence or worstening of symtpms), is commonly a challenging part of MDMA therapy. You can think of it as standing up. Sitting and standing are both stable positions. The transition positions between the two are unstable, but must be passed through if you want to walk anywhere \cite{olthofDestabilization}. Therapeutic destabilization is associated with better outcomes later in therapy, however it can negatively impact your life if it is severe enough and not managed well. We think the following is a likely schema-based description of destabilization: Initially, multiple schemas and defense cascade states may work together to create a relatively stable but unhealthy pattern of behavior and emotions. Unlearning all or most of the schemas in that pattern may be necessary to reach a healthier pattern, but that can't be done all at once. Starting the reconsolidation process triggers an intermediary period where some schemas still exist but no longer form as stable of a pattern. We suspect some of them may react to the new state by strengthening and possibly activating defense cascade states. We are not aware of any papers demonstrating this, but, based on a number of anecdotal reports from reddit.com/r/mdmatherapy, we think it's highly likely that psychedelic therapy tends to produce stronger destabilization (and more rapid therapeutic progress) than traditional psychotherapy. See Section \ref{assessDestabilizationRisk} for tips on assessing this risk. We recommend \textcite{hayes2020complex} for a more thorough theoretical explanation of destabilization.

Another sign of an immanent shift is lowered "pull" (critical slowing) of the old state. 

Complex systems frequently have nonlinear dynamics, where improvement, worsening, and destabilization can come at unforeseen moments. 

Activating and feeling the emotions of the target schema is necessary to enable reconsolidation \cite{ecker2015misunderstood} \footnote{Emotional activation is necessary because the schemas addressed in therapy almost always involve strong emotions. One can reconsolidate schemas that don't involve emotion without emotional activation.}. We think of it as focus-meditation, where you hold the feeling or belief of the schema in focus and gently dismiss distracting thoughts about, for instance, how beautiful the trees are. This can be deeply uncomfortable, but in our experience the MDMA almost always makes it bearable. The discomfort will be temporary; MDMA-induced reconsolidation will dissipate it over 10s of minutes. Insightful thoughts about how trauma impacted you or insights into human behavior may arise. Spend time on them if they feel cathartic or important. Leave them until after the session if they don't feel cathartic or important, reserving limited session time for reconsolidation or new experiences of profound wellbeing. It may also help to hold the schema with compassionate curiosity and agnosticism with regard to its truth. We have observed that activating and feeling the emotions of maladaptive schemas is a necessary part of MDMA therapy. Thinking can be useful, but only if it occurs in conjunction with feeling. Thinking by itself is a waste.

Once you've found one of those, stay present with it, and it will reconsolidate.

We've noticed that successful reconsolidation presents as either: 1) the schema gradually dissipating or becoming uninteresting, or 2) negative emotions transforming into positive ones. 

We have observed (1 data point) that you can later use (with extensive practice) this knowledge of deep inner wellbeing to mismatch almost any maladaptive schema without the need for MDMA. We think that ability is enormously useful. See Section \ref{sec:moreReconsolidation} for instructions. (regular life will rarely be total bliss, but the experience does point you in the right direction)



When a schema is healed you should notice that although the pain and maladaptive beliefs and behavior are diminished, a level of caution remains. If this caution is helpful rather than overwhelming, then this is the schema in its adaptive, rather than maladaptive form. This caution will aid you in avoiding future harm.

PTSD makes us feel as though we are by our nature isolated; MDMA can help people feel as though they are by their nature connected to one another. This may be one of the central mechanisms of healing that both therapy and MDMA provide.

 For further discussion of how to decide when to stop using medicine, see Section \ref{sec:moreReconsolidation}.

 The term was introduced by John Welwood, a Buddhist teacher and psychotherapist. 

 interpret the effects of MDMA and the reconsolidation process as spiritual., Because MDMA can produce profound spiritual experiences for those individuals who interpret their MDMA experience in a spiritual way, it may be important to take care to avoid spiritual bypass if MDMA experiences are to actually facilitate healing. In particular, the profundity of many MDMA experiences may lead one to feel that focusing on painful maladaptive schemas is simply no longer necessary; however, without that focus, the schemas will not be reconsolidated, and healing will not be accomplished to the degree it otherwise could be.

 The intense emotions and beliefs you felt during the session may have been the schemas that have been negatively affecting your life. You will react and think differently now after the emotions and beliefs of your schema have updated. 

 You might have had profound feelings or thoughts about various belief systems, sociocultural systems, organizations, etc. MDMA can spur profound insights. The feelings of trust, safety, and increased perspective inherent to many MDMA experiences can cause us to take the profound thoughts and feelings we have during those experiences as objective truth, which they may or may not be \cite{hartogsohn2018meaning}. Psychedelics inflate feelings of meaning. Rather, MDMA can offer a new perspective based on a state of heightened, but incomplete compassion and safety. Real insights may get mixed up with inaccurate interpretations. Even in these exceptional states of consciousness, all your still-unconscious emotions are deeply influencing your beliefs and feelings. Seek high quality critiques of your beliefs and incorporate beliefs into rigorous higher level frameworks \cite{saganDemon}. Correct for cognitive biases and aim for a balanced perspective when evaluating new ideas \cite{galefScoutMindset}. will more reliably lead you to what is objectively accurate or helpful for your life.

  As \textcite{ecker2015misunderstood} stated: "When two mutually contradictory schemas are juxtaposed consciously, the schema that more comprehensively or credibly models reality, and therefore more usefully predicts how the world will behave, reveals the other schema to be false, and the falsified one is immediately transformed [reconsolidated] accordingly." So presumably, inviolable-well-of-inner-safety, while not necessarily representing absolute truth, is more true (at least in the context of my personal lived experience) than my previous set of beliefs that did not include an inviolable well of inner safety.

  Predictions and the belief component of schemas seem like the same thing. 

Feels like they have to save the world with this book to feel safe. 

    \item Many other constructs in psychology are similarly a-mechanistic, or only defined in terms of other a-mechanistic constructs.

(e.g. "I am bad," as opposed to low-level schemas that control, say body temperature, which remain largely unaltered)

If you have significant uncertainty about your particular issue, it may be worth trying MDMA therapy if you meet the safety criteria (see Section \ref{sec:safety}) and the cost is reasonable. It offers some chance of addressing the problem if it is schema-based, and very low risk if you don't have any emotional issues, though destabilization is a significant risk if your problem is schema-based. 

Questionaires may be "valid" in the sense that they correlate well to other questionaires, but questionaire 
These assessments strongly depend on the patient or clinician's understanding of the semanic meaning of words in the questionaire, what is normal, the client's capacity for accurate introspection and reporting, etc.

The brain actively controls attention to obtain the most relevant information in any particular context \cite{clark2015surfing}. 



 and the principles of Self Determination Theory (Appendix \ref{sec:sdt})


  and is largely, in our opinion, a reasonable extrapolation of those sections

  These mechanisms likely all rely on some combination of innate biology and learned schemas that are different for different individuals.
    \item Is a single therapeutically-relevant schema like "no one love me" represented as a single Bayesian prior or set of priors?

"a large, complex network of largely unconscious schemas developed into a perception/action model that was helpful at one point \cite{clark2015surfing}." The brain is a vast network of almost-entirely unconscious schemas that  process sensory input, model reality, model its own model, control action, and control attention itself, all wound up together in one immensely complicated recursive loop.

This is a fundamental process enabling adaption to new situations, but a few things can inhibit this updating process by preventing this conscious contradiction, causing our schemas to keep operating in older, no-longer-adaptive ways.:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Avoidance:} Escapist habits, distrusting your thoughts or body, inability to tolerate uncomfortable emotions, escapist habits, fear that updating a schema will make you vulnerable in some way, denial, rationalization, total avoidance of the thing you're maladaptively afraid of, etc. \cite{hayes2020complex}. There is such a thing as healthy avoidance, which is temporary and helps you cope in non-destructive ways until you have the space to process.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Resources or Skills:} Not having a quiet moment or space to investigate and feel your emotions. Being unsure about the reasons for your reactions or how to handle them. Or you may be able to notice and label feelings, sometimes called Alexithymia \cite{hogeveen2021alexithymia}. Making schemas explicit, like with labeling, can aid the brain's built in contradiction-detection processes.
    \item \textbf{Fight-or-Flight or Dissociation:} These defense cascade states frequently inhibit prediction error \cite{razviPSIP}.
    \item \textbf{Schemas May Just be Hard to Update in General:} All complex decision systems, such as the brain, must trade off between multiple goals. The psychiatrist Scott Alexander speculates in a blog post that the brain must trade off between two failure modes (these failure modes are well-established in artificial neural networks): overgeneralization and over-specificity \cite{alexanderMountains}. Say that Alice was mean to you one time. An overgeneralized prediction may be that all people are mean all the time. An over-specific prediction may be that Alice is only mean on Mondays, while wearing a blue shirt, when it is sunny out. Neither of these predictions are useful or correct; the correct prediction might be "sometimes people have bad days and take it out on others." Learning the correct prediction is difficult, and the brain must often make hasty guesses because learning a prediction too slowly can be risky in threatening situations. All of this possibly results in a messy system that sometimes generates overly-strong and durable predictions that require unusual circumstances to contradict.
    \item \textbf{Pervasive Threat Expectations Impede Updating:} \textcite{berghSelfEvidencing} hypothesizes that high-level schemas predicting pervasive threat broadly impair awareness of contradictory evidence. \textcite{alexanderPrecision} provides a more accessible summary of the paper.
\end{itemize}
The schema stays stuck in its maladaptive configuration, replaying and creating problems when these continually inhibit prediction error for a maladaptive schema \cite{rachmanProcessing,eckerUnlocking}.

We suspect there are opioid-mediated dissociative states that don't neatly fit into the defense cascade model. Some individuals "...feel sober, or bored or sleepy as if they could get up and go about their day." during MDMA sessions where the individual can presumably move and think fairly well, but remains emotionally numbed \cite{razviPSIP}. While we can't be sure that this phenomenon is always opioid-mediated, we think it is often because emotional numbing is a known effect of opioids \cite{lanius2018review}, and we aren't aware of any other mechanism that would cause such a degree of numbing as to make an MDMA trip feel boring.

, or the various pseudoscientific beliefs popular in mainstream psychotherapy

We suspect that in some cases a stable state of mental illness is actually only semi-stable, and one can transition to an even worse and potentially more stable state in certain unusual conditions. People occasionally uncover horrifying memories of abuse during MDMA therapy, and after the session end up with stable and much worse symptoms than before. We suspect this new state already existed in an inactive state, but was unreachable because of strong avoidance mechanisms that prevented access to that memory. Psychedelics are famous for their capacity to decrease avoidance. Completely avoiding these memories for the rest of your life is not healthy, as the schemas that abuse creates are generally important and active in peoples' lives. It's conceivable that a skilled therapist who you align well with could help you gently ease into these distressing memories instead of confronting them all at once. However, psychedelic experiences are famously difficult to control, and we think it's likely harder to maintain an easing-in pace during MDMA therapy. This symptom-worsening issue is further complicated in practice because people are sometimes avoiding a multitude of distressing things and possibly multiple associated even-more maladaptive and stable states. It's also easily possible that this even-worse state is not stable, and will naturally resolve to an even-better state of mental health.

The Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics (REBUS) model hypothesizes that LSD, psilocybin, and DMT work by relaxing all high level (abstract beliefs, unlike low-level prios that, say, maintain homeostasis) priors \cite{carhart2019rebus}. Incoming interoceptive sensory information gains relative strength compared to typically-entrenched maladaptive priors. This normal interoceptive information is then sufficient to reconsolidate the maladaptive priors when those priors are activated during psychedelic-assisted therapy. Relaxation of all high level priors also explains other features of these drugs like hallucinations.

MDMA causes much less hallucination than psilocybin, so it likely doesn't relax all high level priors \cite{studerus2010psychometric}. 

% \Section{Factors for Success}
% \label{assessDestabilizationRisk}
% We suspect the conditions below increase the chances of lasting healing and reduce the risk of destabilization and symptom worsening. While meeting all of them is not necessary for success, the more you have, the easier it will be. A good therapeutic alliance with a mental health professional can probably offset a lack of some of these. Many individuals with a history of trauma or mental illness have absorbed an "I have to do it all myself" or "these things were so long ago I should be over them already" attitude from difficult life circumstances, which makes it hard for them to feel they deserve supportive care. We hope this list will assist you in giving yourself credit for the difficulty of your endeavors, and help you give yourself permission to seek more support if that would be right for you. Consider these carefully when deciding what degree of professional guidance you need:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Access to resources: stable housing, financial security, stable healthy relationships, free time to process without compromising material stability, and friends or family skilled in emotional support.
%     \item Understanding of healthy emotional behaviors (awareness of difficult moods and tools to manage them, conflict resolution, etc.).
%     \item Some degree of impulse control
%     \item Grit to navigate challenges in the healing process. Capacity to do between-session reconsolidation. Motivation to experiment with therapeutic methods to find what works for you.
%     \item Time for and access to a secure and inviting space for your sessions, post-session rest, and reflection.
%     \item Independence from those who have traumatized you, especially if they might react poorly to your insights and improvements. Most maladaptive schemas protected you at one point in your life. Dismantling these protections while you are still in a dangerous situation may be risky.
%     \item A habit of inquiring why you have the beliefs and behaviors you do. Acknowledgement that many of them are strongly influenced by psychological and social factors, particularly from early-childhood \cite{brownAttachmentDisturbances}.
%     \item Ability to identify dysregulation.
%     \item Good therapeutic alliance if you're working with a mental health professional \cite{fluckiger2018alliance}.
%     \item Absence of severe mental health problems such as CPTSD, attachment disorders, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders, and personality disorders. We aren't aware of any high-quality research on how to predict destabilization and symptom worsening, but we strongly suspect the trauma reactions we just listed are major factors. If we had to pick one scale you can rate yourself with we would suggest the Maladaptive Schema Scale by \textcite{maladaptiveSchemaScale}. Unfortunately we aren't sure how to translate a specific score to specific recommendations on much good professional assistance is important for helping you in managing destabilization. The best we can recommend is using this as a vibe-check that you integrate with the other complexities of your personal situation.

We believe MDMA therapy presents a significant increase in the potential cost-quality curve of therapy and provides a much-needed tool for cases that haven't responded well to other approaches \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2,mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial}.

Outcome measures continued to deacrease after each of the three doses administered during the trials, suggesting additional doses would further increase healing \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial,mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}. 

\footnote{MDMA is sold in hydrochloride salt form, and all stated masses are masses of the hydrochloride salt form \cite{liechtiInteractions}. MDMA is made as a racemic (equal) mixture of the R-MDMA and S-MDMA enantiomers (a right or left-handed version of a molecule), though it is possible to purify either enantiomer \cite{straumann2024racemic}. They have different effects.}

 is highly controversial. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to figure out how likely LLM therapy is to help in the current (2025) information environment of high AI attitude polarization, minimal high quality research, high rates of technological change, and wildly conflicting reports of LLMs providing everything from desperately needed and healthy help to fueling delusions of grandiosity.

  MDMA's effects of safety and empathy also decrease avoidance and facilitate staying present with difficult schemas, one of the prerequisites of reconsolidation.

This does not imply that destabilization due to abusive or incompetent therapists or guides is helpful. 

These issues can presumably be solved, at least in part, though the methods outlined in this book for reconsolidating any maladaptive schema. 

These drive unusually-strong attention to ambiguous sensory information and interpret it as persistence of threatening illness or injury.

Fixing these issues might require reconsolidating the high-pervasive-threat schema and any schemas driving avoidance of bodily awareness in addition to the specific symptom-producing schema, since the former two continually reinforce the latter. We don't know if MDMA can facilitate reconsolidation of this type of symptom-producing schema, but the high-pervasive-threat and avoidance schemas sound like the type MDMA can help with. Any practice that directly increases attention to bodily sensations may also help if the practice doesn't get categorized as a threat itself.

This might involve using the type of touch or movement that would produce symptom perception, but started at a gentle enough level that doesn't actually cause symptom perception. Gradually increasing intensity over time will gradually raise the learned threshold that triggers symptom perception. This suggests things like sports, yoga, accupuncture, gradual progressive strength training, etc. may work.

We wanted to include our relevant personal motivations and attachments so that the reader can better contextualize this book within a greater truth-seeking process. Unfortunately we quickly ran into the issue of our motivations being impenetrable tangles of conscious and unconscious beliefs. We could have tried to break off a few of these that seem most relevant, but even that assumes our honest self-analytic capacity is operating accurately. Self-analysis is one portion of the brain's predictive-processing network trying to model the whole network. It is fundamentally impossible for small neural networks to perfectly model larger neural networks. Additionally, self-analysis also seems heavily optimized for self-deception about a great many things. Sorry.

\footnote{I had a long list of attachments and beliefs that are important to how and why I wrote this book. However, over 1000 hours of reconsolidation has taught me that accurate self-assessment of foundational beliefs-and why I have those beliefs-is at best tenuous. Many explicitly stated beliefs are incorrect post-hoc constructed narratives and rationales that obscure more complex, incoherent, or unpleasant sets of unconscious schemas. You'll have to infer my values from reading the book.}

T.H. and M.G. then shared writing, editing, concept development, and research. We shared editing equally.

 We've included a few of our relevant motivations, attachments, and beliefs despite the fact that complete self-knowledge is fundamentally impossible and people are heavily incentivized to self-deceive in certain ways. We've also chosen to not include some less-palatable beliefs and motivations in the interest of not turning off potential readers.

 \footnote{We're assuming that people want their actions to be aligned with their moral beliefs, and that their set of fundamental moral beliefs should not contradict each other. In other words, their action-belief system is coherent.}

 It may be impossible to really determine if you should some of these groups have worth. Then the question becomes: how should I act if there's a 50/50 (or whatever) chance a group has worth?

\todo{How do you put yourself in their (possibly the opposing team) shoes?}
Cultivating empathy can enrich your connection to others and spur compassionate action, thus creating healthier societies and decreasing suffering. Research has identified three forms of empathy: affective empathy, cognitive empathy, and empathic concern. "Affective empathy” refers to having an emotional experience you believe you are sharing with another. Unfortunately, we are often inaccurate in our assessment of what emotions other beings are actually experiencing. "Cognitive empathy” refers to our ability to logically understand how others feel, and also why they feel the way they do-what all the contributing factors are, and how those factors work. Finally, "empathic concern” refers to our desire for others to have good things.

Among the helping professions, higher levels of affective empathy are associated with burnout and poor client care. When a caregiver is experiencing high levels of affective empathy, they are naturally motivated to address their own distress by helping the client with what they perceive is wrong-which may or may not have anything to do with what the client actually needs or is actually experiencing. In contrast, in these same populations, higher levels of cognitive empathy and empathic concern are protective against burnout and correlate to higher quality client care. As such, when we talk about cultivating empathy, we are talking about increasing your levels of cognitive empathy and empathic concern. To illustrate: suppose your friend is a father, who feels angry and powerless about his teenage daughter's choice to dye her hair purple. You might feel affective empathy towards his powerlessness, relating to the way his status in the community might be negatively impacted by her choices. However, it may be that his distress is not connected to feelings about status, but only to concern about her welfare and what the change may signal about his daughter's mental health. Your ability to effectively exercise compassion towards this father is contingent on the quality of your cognitive empathy-your ability to accurately assess and communicate where his needs, feelings and concerns are actually coming from.

Much of the existing research on increasing positive emotional states of kindness and compassion, associated with cognitive empathy and empathic concern, is focused on compassion meditation and loving kindness meditation. We feel that these practices are worth a try for most people (see \textcite{lkMeditation} for instructions), as they are correlated with a number of positive outcomes. We also speculate that therapeutic MDMA sessions may offer an opportunity to jump-start or supercharge the process of cultivating cognitive empathy and empathic concern. Completing a compassion meditation during the MDMA session could be helpful for this. Alternatively, you might focus specifically on cultivating cognitive empathy through the following contemplative exercise:

During a session, look at photos of other beings and consider what you share with them, what facilitates their wellbeing, what they deserve, and what obligations you may have to them given the significance of their moral worth. As with a classical compassion meditation, you might start with yourself or someone who you find easy to generate compassion for, and then slowly by degrees work your way out through other categories of beings you may not feel as connected to. We believe non-human animals (and conceivably current or future artificial intelligences, though without any widely-accepted and experimentally validated theory of consciousness this is highly uncertain) are an important target for consideration and compassion because, as a large group of biologists and philosophers recently asserted \cite{newYorkAnimal}:

\begin{quotation}
    First, there is strong scientific support for attributions of conscious experience [having subjective experiences; not necessarily being self-aware] to other mammals and to birds.
    
    Second, the empirical evidence indicates at least a realistic possibility of conscious experience in all vertebrates (including reptiles, amphibians, and fishes) and many invertebrates (including, at minimum, cephalopod mollusks, decapod crustaceans, and insects)

    Third, when there is a realistic possibility of conscious experience in an animal, it is irresponsible to ignore that possibility in decisions affecting that animal. We should consider welfare risks and use the evidence to inform our responses to these risks.
\end{quotation}

We posit that taking a holistic approach to compassion and cognitive empathy can avoid major oversights in our personal actions and beliefs, allowing us to maximize the benefits of a more connected and compassionate life by exercising compassion in areas where we otherwise might not have. Additionally, we posit that formalizing your compassionate impulses can sometimes lead to better prioritization and better outcomes. Both of these practices may assist us in expanding our moral intuition into new situations.

We also recommend that practitioners be cautious of major ethical readjustments during or after an MDMA trip, just as you would be with major life choice changes. Particularly high caution is warranted around actions that involve harm to some beings in the pursuit of a greater goal \cite{askellSelfServing}. While we are often faced with difficult choices, these types of actions often have toxic personal, organizational, and reputational effects. We recommend thinking through the many effects of your actions, including their larger systemic and relational impacts. Such actions are also commonly used as a, perhaps unconscious, rationalization of unconscious ego-related schemas. We suggest that deeper exploration and reconsolidation of maladaptive schemas, including those listed in Section \ref{uncovering}, will help you better align personal actions with the needs of all beings.

When recovering from trauma, it is common for one's moral framework to become intertwined with maladaptive schemas-leading to unhealthy ethical frameworks like the "I must save the world to be a valid person” belief Gabor Mate discusses in "The Body Says No.” (Also see Section \ref{psychogenic} on psychogenic illnesses) At the same time, cultures and institutions often dismiss major harms-current examples relevant to mainstream US culture include childbirth trauma and the trauma of living through a mass extinction; past examples include enslavement or "resettlement schools.” In situations like these, we posit that traumatized survivors represent an important repository of experience, essential for crafting cultural shifts that could help avoid the future repetition of these and similar harms. As such, it is important not to dismiss the moral intuition generated by traumatic experience, but rather to approach it with compassionate curiosity, as one important source of insight among many.

\section{Cognitive Flexibility and Truth-Seeking}
We assert that cognitive flexibility is both highly important and lower than it should be for most people in the modern world. Intense tribalism seems to be a major reason why. It may have been selected for in a past where survival was much more tenuous than in it today for most people, and where societies were much smaller. While we still need to form coalitions (family, workplace relationships, friendships, etc.) to accomplish almost anything, we suspect our tribal tendency is overpowered for life in relatively safe nation-states. This creates all sorts of problems, such as poor governmental policy because of people vote based on identity \cite{klein2020Polarized} rather than good policy, being shunned for believing or doing things that have become a marker of belonging to a rival group, etc.

As the psychologist David Pinsof says on their blog about self-deception being a core aspect of tribalism \cite{pinsof2024Truth}:
\begin{quotation}
	We're hyper-skeptical of claims made by the outgroup-the people we fear, dislike, and distrust. And we believe ingroup-flattering absurdities ... because it is instrumentally rational for us to do so. The benefits of status and tribal solidarity often outweigh the costs of false beliefs, particularly if those beliefs are vague, unactionable, or unfalsifiable.
\end{quotation}
We may also embrace harmful beliefs when most of the benefits accrue to us personally, but the costs are spread out among many people. It's like emitting pollution; it's often the cheapest option for you, but the damage is spread over so many people that they have a very difficult time coordinating with each other to stop it \cite{coaseTheorem}.

It is common to perceive obviously false beliefs in the out-group. But how do you know they are wrong and you aren't? The human capacity for self-deception must be strong enough to make at least one of you wrong about a supposedly obvious fact, and we have no foolproof a priori reason to believe it is them instead of us. We think self-deception frequently relies on avoidance of discomfort (being wrong, the potential for being shunned, knowing you have done something harmful, etc.). MDMA notably increases tolerability of discomfort, and therefore we speculate it could be useful as an avoidance-decreasing tool useful for deliberately gathering more accurate evidence and coming to more accurate beliefs about things people commonly deceive themselves about. For instance, during an MDMA session you might consider the implications of a hated political group being correct about some important piece of policy. This might also bring up some fears that you can then reconsolidate. Presumably, some improvements to cognitive flexibility depend on perceiving that there are attainable alternative social situations for you. If you are trapped in a cult without even a slight perceived chance (even unconscious) of possible escape, MDMA therapy might just help you better adapt to that situation.

We live in a world of pervasive threats, fear-based messaging, and out-group demonization/dehumanization. Because of this, we believe additional strategies beyond reconsolidation and avoidance-reduction are likely necessary to maintain cognitive flexibility and compassion in the long-run. We have a few recommendations for this:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{The Scout Mindset} by Julia Galef \cite{galefScoutMindset}. "When it comes to what we believe, humans see what they want to see. In other words, we have what Julia Galef calls a "soldier” mindset. From tribalism and wishful thinking, to rationalizing in our personal lives and everything in between, we are driven to defend the ideas we most want to believe—and shoot down those we don't.

    But if we want to get things right more often, argues Galef, we should train ourselves to have a 'scout' mindset. Unlike the soldier, a scout's goal isn't to defend one side over the other. It's to go out, survey the territory, and come back with as accurate a map as possible. Regardless of what they hope to be the case, above all, the scout wants to know what's actually true.
    
    In The Scout Mindset, Galef shows that what makes scouts better at getting things right isn't that they're smarter or more knowledgeable than everyone else. It's a handful of emotional skills, habits, and ways of looking at the world—which anyone can learn."
    \item \textit{Why We're Polarized} by Ezra Klein discusses the self-reinforcing feedback loops between our fears and identities and the behavior of the media and politicians \cite{klein2020Polarized}. This cycle increases polarization, political dysfunction, and separates us from each other. This book is more about understanding the role of identity in politics than suggestions on how to improve the situation.
    \item \textit{How Minds Change: The Surprising Science of Belief, Opinion, and Persuasion} by David McRaney is an excellent survey of the topic \cite{mcraneyMinds}.
    \item The blog post \textit{Trapped Priors As A Basic Problem Of Rationality} by Scott Alexander lays out a mechanistic explanation of how false beliefs can become entrenched despite abundant contradictory evidence \cite{alexanderTrapped}.
\end{itemize}


This might bring up some fears that you can then reconsolidate. Presumably, some improvements to cognitive flexibility depend on perceiving that there are attainable alternative social situations for you. If you are trapped in a cult without even a slight perceived chance (even unconscious) of possible escape, MDMA therapy might just help you better adapt to that situation.

We don't know what this phenomenon is. A few weeks roughly equals the length of time of a certain type of increased neuroplasticity that \textcite{nardouMDMAPlasticity} found following MDMA sessions in mice. However, that lab's results with psilocybin have failed to replicate, calling their MDMA results into question too \cite{Lu2025noplasticity}. It could be that something about your MDMA session or your expectations about MDMA therapy temporarily deactivated the set of schemas that cause your problems. Perhaps one schema of a set of self-reinforcing schemas deactivated, and then the whole network of self-reinforcing schemas deactivated. Those schemas may eventually re-activate in the presence of their regular triggers if they are not reconsolidated.

We recommend spending more effort on, and experimenting with sober reconsolidation exercises (see Section \ref{sec:moreReconsolidation}) in this period rather than more frequent MDMA use if this phenomenon occurs for you. You may even find that maxing-out your reconsolidation capacity every day will deliver very large amounts of therapeutic progress. Developing the skill of sober reconsolidation can reduce your therapeutic reliance on MDMA and allow reconsolidation in a wide variety of circumstances where MDMA use is not appropriate. When well-developed it could also allow faster healing because the safety and logistical considerations of MDMA therapy are no longer limiting.

You might go through cycles of noticing new and interesting sensations or thoughts that feel really good at first then dissipate with time. We think this is positively-valenced prediction error caused by bringing attention to previously-avoided things. The error will gradually update your schemas until the new sensations or thoughts become the unremarkable new normal.

This was found in clinical settings where physical activity was low and temperature moderate.

Hyponatremia can become severe if the individual sweats a lot without replenishing the lost salt, or drinks large amounts of unsalted fluid, as sometimes occurs at dance parties \cite{vanOverheatingAlcohol}.

 Exercise increased caution if your body has severe problems regulating its temperature because MDMA raises body temperature by $0.2$-$0.8^{\circ}$C or $0.4$-$1.4^{\circ}$F \cite{liechti2014effects}.

 Replacing fluids and sodium will become more important to avoid dangerous heat illness (MDMA further raises body temperature by $0.2$-$0.8^{\circ}$C or $0.4$-$1.4^{\circ}$F\cite{liechti2014effects}) and hyponatremia if the environment is hot enough to cause sustained heavy sweating during the session (MDMA can further increase sweating \cite{colcott2024side}).

  These are assuredly a limited subset of the full set of disorders associated with childhood trauma.

      \item The Challenging Psychedelic Experiences Project also has a lot of information on extended difficulties from psychedelics \cite{peersupportgroup}.

 The original data showed that the values reported here were generally much higher in the MDMA group than the placebo group, indicating that these symptoms are mostly caused by MDMA. Cells with an * indicate that the placebo value was equal to or higher than the MDMA value. Two rows of the original data were ommitted because MDMA had minimal effect on them.

 Psychedelic experiences are famously prone to strangeness, and we wanted to include at least one illustration of how this can play out, at least in one instance. 

  % \item Suicidal ideation, psychosis, and mania are dangerous states, and, as detailed below, there is an unresolved gap between expert consensus and evidence on the risk of MDMA or psychedelic therapy exacerbating these conditions. Experts tend to recommend either avoidance of psychedelics, or, increasingly, caution and high levels of support for individuals with these conditions or at high risk of these conditions \cite{la2022Psychosis}. High levels of skilled, ethical, and well-matched psychological and psychiatric support are undoubtably beneficial for individuals with these conditions. However, as far as we can tell, the belief that MDMA therapy tends to cause or make these conditions worse has not been established by clear evidence. Here is the best information we have been able to find on the subject:
    %     \begin{itemize}
    %         \item \textbf{Suicidal Ideation:} MDMA therapy with high levels of support decreases suicidal ideation about as much as placebo with therapy, on average \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial,mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}. When interpreting these results it is important to note that average improvements can mask the possibility that a small portion of individuals can get worse even while the majority improve, though this applies to the placebo group as much as the MDMA group.
    %         \item \textbf{Psychosis:} There is virtually no high quality experimental data because people with a history of psychosis are usually excluded from clinical trials of psychedelics \cite{la2022Psychosis}. Case reports of psychotic episodes induced by MDMA are rare and typically, though not always, report confounding factors like co-use with other psychoactive drugs, chronic abuse of other drugs, lack of verification of MDMA ingestion, heat stroke, hyponatremia, extreme doses, or extreme frequency of use \cite{psychosisTreatment,arnovitzSchizophrenia,mcguirePsychosis,patelPsychosis,vaivaPsychosis}. One participant out of 174 in the MDMA phase III clinical trials reported a psychotic episode after the trial ended in poorly-documented circumstances, even though participants reporting any personal history (family history was allowed) of psychotic disorders were excluded from participation \cite{powerTrip,smithSystematic,mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}. We have personally heard of two cases of temporary psychosis leading to hospitalization triggered by a high-dose psilocybin trip conducted the day after an MDMA therapy session. This suggests a lack of adequate recovery between sessions is a major risk factor. \textcite{psychosisTreatment} found that when psychedelics were implicated in psychotic episodes, the episode lasted an average of 1.8 weeks with psychiatric treatment.
    %         \item \textbf{Mania:} There is virtually no high quality experimental data because people with a history of mania (less-so hypomania) are usually excluded from clinical trials of psychedelics \cite{gardBipolar}. The MDMA phase III trials did not exclude individuals with bipolar II and no manic episodes were reported \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}. One small, uncontrolled study of psilocybin-assisted therapy for people with bipolar II but not currently in a hypomanic state showed good efficacy and safety when combined with a high level of support \cite{aaronsonBipolarII}. We aren't sure how well that translates to MDMA therapy. Notably, we couldn't find a single case report of mania where MDMA was unambiguously involved in the recent past, and are therefore confused why MDMA and disorders involving mania are often considered a risky combination. Perhaps it is because bipolar I frequently also involves psychosis, which does have a link to MDMA use, even though it seems rare and typically associated with exacerbating factors not seen in therapeutic contexts.
    %     \end{itemize}
    %  We think the clearest line of reasoning for MDMA therapy triggering these conditions is that 1) high stress is a known risk factor for psychotic or manic episodes \cite{winkelPsychosisStress,Umeoka2021stressmania}, and 2) MDMA therapy is known to occasionally create high amounts of stress through confronting previously-avoided traumatic memories or other types of destabilization (see Section \ref{sec:complex}). Of course, this also implies that MDMA therapy can reduce the risk of psychotic or manic episodes when MDMA therapy resolves existing stress. It also suggests that high quality psychological support before, during, and after the session would indeed reduce risks. We don't know any way to predict whether MDMA therapy will help or hurt in any specific situation. Conclusively resolving the gap between low evidence of risk and expert consensus will require much more research.

 It's conceivable that MDMA therapy might optimize for violence or manipulativeness in humans who truly lack (not just an apparent lack due to maladaptive schemas) certain fundamental error sources such as empathy, and who currently have "maladaptive" schemas inhibiting them from violence or manipulativeness they would otherwise find fulfilling.

  These quantities are far higher than we've heard of anyone using in therapy.

  Everything in HiTOP fits this category except some chemical addictions, some thought disorders, and maybe some other odds and ends.   The second claim is our informed hunch.

      \item Something being a disorder depends on a value judgement of that thing being bad. Thus, different cultures and value systems disagree about what things are mental disorders.

 Truthfully, this is also a list of M.G.'s personal grievances with the field that emerged out of decades of useless and disempowering psychiatric and psychotherapeutic treatments.

Much public medical information seems to be poor quality and/or not practically usable, in large part because it’s optimized for avoidance of liability \cite{webMD}. We hope to offer a better resource by spending almost no effort optimizing for liability. It is also true that t

 These disclaimers are serious; it isn't just disingenuous boilerplate legal stuff.

 In practice, we only know of two instances of this happening, both involving other types of severe therapist misconduct \cite{sessa2015underground,lindsayLicense}.

  We strongly recommend identifying and at least briefly connecting with a therapist or guide you might want to work with in case you get into deeper water than you are comfortable with.  While this model has worked for many people, we are unsure of the risk/benefit trade off.

      % If this synthesis is correct and useful, why did it take someone with no relevant degree or professional experience to put it together? Possible answers: No researcher would get funding for this. The format is too unusual to be used as currency for getting tenure. Legal liability. Attachment to established practices and beliefs. Lack of time. Lack of personal experience. M.G. had exceptional motivation for completing this project and getting the theory mechanistically correct right.

Finally, long term follow-up results submitted to the FDA suggest that the healing is durable, and the advantage of MDMA over placebo was maintained in the long term \cite{mplongPreliminary}. 

 A couple issues with data collection and study design at MAPS combined with confusion and process issues at the FDA seem to be primary factors; not necessarily poor efficacy or safety, though a better trial could show worse efficacy or safety.

 % \section{Organizing Community Care}
% \label{sec:organizingcare}
% A significant and increasing body of work supports the effectiveness of peer support within the context of formal mental health services \cite{shalaby2020peer}. At the same time, some have called for a "reimagining" of peer support in order to take advantage of the unique (and perhaps uniquely helpful) qualities of peer support, which reach outside the conventional borders of professional mental health services \cite{gillard2019peer}. It is this latter project to which we hope to contribute, offering strategies and framings drawn from our experiences organizing care on a mutual aid basis, outside the formal mental health system. We have observed that individuals who are struggling with mental illness may be aware that having a strong support network might aid significantly in their recovery, but may also lack the skills or the mental framework to:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Cultivate such a support network
% 	\item Confidently ask for help in a way that is appropriate to each relationship, relationally sustainable, and not manipulative or unduly high-pressure
% 	\item Recognize what specific tasks, activities, or forms of support that network might help them with
% \end{itemize}

% In this section, we will discuss each of these processes and suggest a variety of tools and resources which may or may not be empirically validated, but which we have found helpful in these tasks. Finally, we wish to acknowledge that for a wide variety of reasons, these strategies will not be accessible to everyone. We only hope that for some people, they increase access to sustaining connection and healthy relationships of mutual care.

% \subsection*{Cultivating a Support Network}

% 8\% of Americans report that they don't have any close friends \cite{pewFriends}. \textcite{fehr2008friendship} identifies four components of friendship formation: environmental, individual, situational, and dyadic. This is Fehr's summary of the research of the research on these four factors (emphasis ours):

% \begin{quotation}
% 	A necessary first step for the development of most friendships is that two people's paths must cross. This is more likely to occur if the two people live near one another (e.g., same neighborhood, same building, same floor, same room) than if they do not. Living in a city or, more important, sharing the same work or school \textbf{environment} also increases the likelihood of contact. People who know people also are more likely to become friends. The probability that two individuals will meet increases to the extent that their social networks overlap.
% \end{quotation}

% Once two people meet, whether they decide to pursue a friendship depends on several additional factors. At the \textbf{individual} level, each scrutinizes the other for evidence of disliked qualities or other characteristics that may make him or her unsuitable as a friend. If these exclusion tests are passed, then inclusion tests will follow. It is likely that a friendship will be sought if each perceives the other as attractive, socially skilled, responsive, not shy, and if the two people are similar in a variety of ways.

% If both exclusion and inclusion tests are passed, one might think that a friendship would be inevitable. However, \textbf{situational} factors influence whether a friendship actually is formed. Research on these factors suggests that two people are more likely to develop a friendship if they anticipate ongoing interactions, if they are dependent on one another, if they see one another frequently, and if each person's "friendship dance card" still has some room on it. Finally, the likelihood of friendship formation depends on \textbf{dyadic} variables such as whether the two people like one another and whether there is an appropriate sequencing of the depth and breadth of self-disclosure \cite[p. 68]{fehr2008friendship}.

% In deference to this research–but also from our own experience–we feel that for maximal likelihood of success in building new friendships, one must routinely put oneself in environmental and situational contexts that are conducive to friendship formation. That means contexts that:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Put you in repeated proximity with people you feel you have something in common with, at least some of whom are likely to have resources to spend on a new connection
% 	\item Allow for plenty of friendly, cooperative interactions
% 	\item Provide a reasonably pleasant/low stress environment, at least some of the time
% \end{itemize}

% Here are some ideas for contexts that may meet enough of these criteria to facilitate friend-finding success:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item A workplace or school (ideally in person)–especially effective if full-time and/or residential
% 	\item A meditation group, synagogue, or church congregation
% 	\item Gyms, pools, dance/martial arts/yoga/Pilates studios, and rec-centers
% 	\item Recurring dance nights (salsa, blues, contra, etc.) or jam sessions at various venues
% 	\item Events, clubs, or groups you find through local newsletters and event calendars
% 	\item Events through your public library, senior center, community center, game shop, or farmer's market
% 	\item Night classes through a community college–may focus on art, craft, or trade, or hobby related skills
% 	\item Civic engagement with local government and/or activist groups
% 	\item Long distance hiking adventures known as "through hikes" on the Appalachian Trail or others
% 	\item Volunteering (animal shelter, horse rehab stable, soup kitchen, nonprofit thrift store, etc.)
% 	\item Therapeutic support or self-help groups, such as Buried in Treasures groups or Alanon
% 	\item Festivals, fairs, and conventions–the intense collaboration involved in festivals like burning man \cite{st2018civilised} and Pennsic have been known to facilitate friendship formation in a way that is difficult to replicate in the atomized mundane working world of midlife in the USA.
% 	\item Online services like meetup.com, Bumble BFF, Captain Awkward meetups, or Buy Nothing groups, which connect people for offline interactions
% \end{itemize}

% Some online games or social networking sites can facilitate friendship formation for some users. We recognize that online socializing offers massive accessibility advantages, and we have hope that in the future digital spaces will be designed to facilitate healthy friendship formation \cite{gowen2012young} rather than being designed to extract the maximum amount of data, time, and/or money from participants. For the time being, online socializing is fraught with problematic ethical and mental health impacts–while also providing benefits, including connections that may be indispensable \cite{pantic2014online,kim2022tech,cohen2017relationship,prochnow2021depressive}. It may be that the collaborative activities of gaming or the creativity of posting are more satisfying or helpful for you than reading and reacting to others' posts, and it may be that some games leave you feeling better (or support you in interacting with others in a more satisfying way) than others. In light of these complexities, we recommend checking in with yourself carefully to gather data about how you actually feel before, during, and after specific online activities. We also recommend using whatever executive function supports \todo{Link to executive function section} are necessary to limit your participation in activities that you don't find helpful.

% If you are able to repeatedly and/or protractedly place yourself in a context (environment and situation, in Fehr's framework) which offers you a good chance at proximity with high likelihood potential friends, you will still have the individual and dyadic factors to sort out. Let's return to Fehr's account of individual factors–individuals are looking for someone who is "attractive, socially skilled, responsive, not shy, and if the two people are similar". We will leave the question of attractiveness to the myriad other texts and resources on the topic, other than to point out that the research does suggest that social skills and attractiveness may represent two separate routes to friendship–you don't necessarily need both\footnote{There is clear data that social skills correlate with social support \cite{sarason1985concomitants} and also that attractiveness and social skills represent two separate routes to friendship for women \cite{reis1982physical}. For men the data is less clear–apparently for men, social skills and attractiveness, though still both separately impacting social success, tend to be highly correlated. Since social skills can be taught \cite{brigman1999teaching,sazak2013outcomes}, we feel this raises interesting questions about how men are socialized. Research on the correlations between attractiveness, social success, and social skills in nonbinary people has not yet been published. Despite these complexities, we strongly recommend social skill development as a path to greater social success for all genders. For anyone who is a man or a nonbinary person or who is close to a man or nonbinary person, we recommend Bren{\'e} Brown's workshop Men Women and Worthiness \href{soundstrue.com/products/men-women-and-worthiness}{(soundstrue.com/products/men-women-and-worthiness} as a valuable exploration of gendered challenges in socialization, self disclosure, and life.} —and that attractiveness is relative to context \cite{geiselman1984context,melamed1975effect,little2011facial,moss1975effects,lei2020contrast}.
 
% Fehr identifies the important social skills for friendship formation as initiation (more important in the early finding/making friends stage) and self-disclosure (important for moving from an acquaintanceship to a friendship, and increasingly important as friendships deepen.) Other research suggests that responsiveness (including nonverbal responsiveness) and assertiveness are also important social skills for creating and sustaining satisfying friendships \cite{riggio1986assessment}.

% To work on initiation skills (how to introduce yourself and make a good first impression) we recommend the content and coaching services from Healthy Gamer and advice from Captain Awkward. For folks who feel this would be a reasonable choice for them, we also recommend setting "getting rejected" as a positive goal, as a kind of prolonged exposure practice to desensitize yourself to the downsides of rejection. Finally, we have observed that in some cases, increased confidence in one's "appropriate self-disclosure" skills can make initiation more accessible.

% Our recommended resources for learning appropriate self-disclosure skills are the ladder of bids (see \textcite{gottmanTrust}, Chapter "How Couples Build Trust With Attunement"), along with \textcite{brownDaring} work on "Shame webs vs support networks." We have witnessed considerable transformation in these skills by motivated individuals who practiced applying these tools over time.

% We feel that assertiveness and nonverbal responsiveness are probably best addressed by cultivating a mindset of confidence, compassion, calm, and balanced entitlement, and trying to carry this perspective into social interactions. This is extremely hard to do when one is mentally ill–as, indeed, are the recommendations in this section generally. To cultivate this positive mindset, we recommend the following resources (if you find them helpful and resonant to your own situation):
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item The work of Bren{\'e} Brown generally
% 	\item \textit{Good Inside} by Dr. Becky Kennedy (putatively about parenting, but the general concepts can be applied to relationships with self and others generally). See Section \ref{sec:psychoeducation}.
% 	\item \textit{Grit} by Angela Duckworth
% 	\item \textit{Bird by Bird}, by Anne Lamott
% 	\item \textit{The Upside of Stress}, by Kelly McGonnigal
% 	\item How to live alone and like it (every ism, but very good at teaching people to "romanticize your life"–to tell yourself and others a positive and appealing story about yourself and how you live–and breaking this down into many specific sub-skills and practices)
% 	\item Games like Roots of Pacha
% 	\item Compassion meditation
% 	\item Other mantras ("it's OK to make mistakes", "I am enough/I have enough", "I am becoming consistently capable of lovingly attentive behavior")
% 	\item The Unwinding Anxiety app
% \end{itemize}

% We are sure there are many other resources that would also serve this purpose well. In addition, despite the inherent awkwardness and discomfort of this practice, we would expect role playing with a therapist, coach, or reasonably skilled peer to be an excellent strategy for improving any of these social skills.

 , possibly in part due to MDMA increasing thirst when you don't actually need more water \cite{liechtiGender}

 While there were complex motivations for the War on Drugs, it functions and persists primarily as moral panic, a means to punish certain groups of people, and a means for politicians to disenfranchise and ostracize the voter base of their political opponents. 

 However, the recreational users in that study also used much more MDMA (median of 44 occasions) than is typical in therapeutic use.

     Some observational human studies and controlled high-dose animal studies have found that MDMA use is associated with neurotoxcicity (oxidative stress in this case) or cognitive problems \cite{passieHistory}. However, these problems have not been found in controlled studies in humans. The human observational studies that find problems usually fail to adequately control for multiple-drug use, a significant risk factor. Notably, \textcite{halpernMormonRavers} ruled out high levels of long-term cognitive issues from recreational MDMA use in a population that had exceptionally low lifetime use of other psychoactive substances. Unfortunately the study didn't have the statistical power to rule out low-moderate levels of cognitive issues. One small randomized study of MDMA therapy also did not find any significant cognitive effects \cite{mithoeferSafety}. The animal studies that found problems typically used extreme doses, extreme frequencies of use, or injected the medicine, a more potent method of administration than swallowing a pill \cite{passieHistory}. It's also not clear that humans respond the same way as rats to an equivalent dose. It's possible that replicating these conditions of extreme doses or frequency of use could cause harmful neural oxidative stress in humans. Some studies have found serotonin system changes in humans, but the studies use a poorly controlled cross-sectional observational design \cite{van2022serotonin}. So it's not clear that MDMA, rather than other drug use or population difference, causes these changes, that the changes are bad, or that the changes are clinically significant even if they are bad. The changes appear to decrease with abstinence. Fear and misinformation about MDMA is widespread due to the War on Drugs, sensationalized of poor quality research, and misattribution of MDMA-related deaths as an inherent risk of MDMA instead of its interactions with certain medications and health conditions, and the risks of heat illness or hyponatremia at raves \cite{passieHistory}. See chapter "The Toxicity Debate" in The History of MDMA by Torsten Passie for a comprehensive review of the topic.

As described in Sections \ref{frequency} and \ref{sec:safety}, we have been unable to find any high-quality evidence suggesting that this session frequency causes problems aside from a poorly-established association with increased risk of "loss of magic \cite{farreTolerance,parrottTolerance}." It also hasn't been rigorously tested. M.G. did 2 week spacing for a while and didn't notice any increased side effects.

  Updating-away deidentification might be as infeasible as trying to update-away a model of how floors work.

   See \textcite{laukkonenNone} and \textcite{laukkonen2025beautiful} for some emerging technical discussions.

    Reality is certainly more complex than our model, though we don't know by how much.

    There are a variety of anecdotes from people saying hospitalization helped them \cite{emanuelHospitalization}. 

\item \textbf{Increased Precision-Weighting of Sensory Information:} MDMA, along with meditation and other psychedelics, increases the precision weighting of sensory information. This signal is strong enough to update-away any maladaptive priors when those priors are also activated. With sufficient exposure to this state the individual models the attention-modulation pattern with a new set of second-order priors.
\item \textbf{Reduced Strength of Prediction Error Inhibitors:} MDMA facilitates exceptional reduction of prediction error inhibitors such as low-attention, fight-or-flight, and tonic/collapsed immobility. Then, normal incoming sensory evidence is sufficient to update all maladaptive priors that are activated during the session. With sufficient exposure to the state the individual can somehow learn to recreate it.

\footnote{Many authors call avoidance of bodily sensations dissociation, but we reserve that term for the defense cascade state of immobility.}

% We aren't sure what specific predictions activate forms of dissociation (if they exist) that don't involve immobility and freezing. Presumably at least threat.

 Instead, using afterglow for sober reconsolidation exercises would be a highly productive and create durable long-term improvements to mental health.

In summary, we propose that each case of mental illness or other issue is a unique attractor state whose reinforcing elements are the maladaptive schema and a reconsolidation-inhibiting process like low attention.

This is not traditionally citable material, but we felt 1) this discussion is important to set the stage for the rest of the book, 2) these posts contain unusually high-quality material by practicing scientists, and 3) we don't have the capacity to sufficiently learn and synthesize this area of knowledge ourselves.}

     % \item Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence: We're claiming that one thing, MDMA therapy, can durably resolve a large part of most mental illness. To be fair, it's never actually been established that many mental illnesses don't have a common core. We're not contradicting any established evidence, just some traditional views.

    % \item Planning careful or reduced movement during altered states of consciousness may be advisable if your body is prone to injury from otherwise typical human movement. A sitter, guide, or therapist could help you with this during the session, or you could put an obvious reminder sign in your field of view.

Resilience to trauma is complex \cite{bonanno2008loss}. 

(e.g., \enquote{My friendships remind me that I'm safe in many circumstances.} or \enquote{I am already emotionally secure.}) The risk factors may also also be circumstances that inhibit nuance (e.g.,) or may directly inhibit reconsolidation (e.g., thought suppression).

, even when they have been rigorously shown to be helpful (many haven't been evaluated for long-term efficacy and risk \cite{leuchtDecline}),

\footnote{The phrase \enquote{credibly models reality} may be confusing here, but it includes beliefs about yourself and how you react in various situations, like dogs being threatening enough to trigger a fight-or-flight reaction.}

% The core process of healing is conceptually simple: activate a maladaptive pattern; contradict that pattern (with other knowledge or MDMA-induced feelings of safety) until the pattern dissipates; repeat until satisfied \cite{eckerUnlocking}. Almost all of this manual is just instructions on how to facilitate this process with MDMA or other techniques, and how to manage support for yourself during the longer process of healing.

% One of our main goals is describing what most mental illness actually is and how therapeutic improvement works. We hope this will be more helpful than just repeating the somewhat arbitrary DSM symptom clusters, which sometimes reinforce the belief that mental illness requires long-term treatment in cases where it can actually be durably resolved. This only applies to a subset of conditions. Not all mental disorders can be durably resolved, though it's often unclear which can and cannot.

% Because of the complexities and risks of the practice, we generally recommend starting MDMA therapy with professional assistance. However, availability, cost, or trust obstacles often make adequate professional assistance hard to access, and many people have to make the best of non-optimal circumstances. 

%We start with an overview of how our minds and bodies respond to trauma, how healing works, and the efficacy of MDMA therapy. Then we describe the practice of MDMA therapy, including the trade-offs of professional guidance vs. self guidance, safety, preparation, how to conduct the session, how to process the session, troubleshooting, and how to minimize overwhelming symptoms. We also discuss a variety of complementary practices and tools. These are not essential to the practice of MDMA therapy itself, but appropriate use will quicken and deepen your overall healing.

% The writing process involved a back-and-forth combining of informal literature review with professional and personal experience. This was also informed by numerous self-reports of MDMA-induced adverse experiences. We resort to many \enquote{we suggest}'s based on our personal and professional experience because the scientific literature on MDMA and psychotherapy is highly inadequate to the task of saying \enquote{this is the best way to do things based on rigorous evidence} for every detail of the process. \todo{We supplemented this with a review from a professional MDMA-guide. We used informal interview data from x other professional MDMA therapists and guides to inform key aspects.}

% As we have observed to be common in fields where groundbreaking research meets deeply vulnerable life experiences, significant power imbalances, and strongly held professional and humanitarian goals, PAT has its share of controversies. These include but are not limited instances where otherwise respected contributors to the field are accused of misconduct or abuse. Our choices of how to weight various information have certainly been informed in places by our own assessment of these conflicts. However, keenly aware of our own fallibility, we wish to resource our readers in exploring the deeper contexts of the things we cite and forming their own opinions, especially in areas where we may be wrong. It is also far beyond the scope of this book to vet every single author we cite. As such, our policy is to always cite such allegations when we know about them, generally without further exploration. These references will be marked by a footnote whenever the author or source who has allegations against them is first cited in a section. As it would be far too lengthy to include, and far too complex or uncertain to accurately convey, we specifically exclude allegations of bias and who takes what side of various ideological conflicts in the psychedelic research scene. \todo{I want to switch to a threshold of \enquote{we personally think something significantly affects an author's work.} The whole point of books like this is to exercise editorial filtering to provide readers with high quality data. Readers shouldn't be filtering through all the raw data themselves.}

\subsection{Cultural/Personal Matrix:}
Unfortunately, the researcher who originated the term \enquote{matrix} was credibly accused of such intense abuse-particularly in the realm of crafting abusive environments and mindsets in those she treated-that we feel her advice on this front must be presented with the context of those allegations foremost \cite{davidsonEisner}. This is despite the fact that this framework, as published, look helpful to us from afar. As such, we encourage you to critically engage with this framework if it appeals to you, and, if you are using it, to pay special care to boundaries, power dynamics, supervision, and other safety mechanisms to avoid misconduct and abuse. \textcite{setSettingMatrix} defines matrix as the \enquote{\ldots environment (1) from which an individual comes, (2) in which the individual lives during the time of the sessions, and (3) to which the individual returns after successful therapy-the everyday living space \ldots} This is important because \enquote{Rapid change is very difficult to sustain if the living environment is the same as the one which caused the difficulties in the first place.} Family, living situation, and culture have complex interactions with the process of MDMA therapy. In some cultures, like those where ayahuasca use is currently endemic in certain areas of South America, knowledge of psychedelics may be widespread and their use accepted. Finding help in dealing with certain after-effects may be much easier in those contexts. Other social or family contexts can be hostile or counterproductive to the process of MDMA therapy. \todo{Reference all the places we talk about this in the paper.}

% We think this approach is associated with the need for post-session \enquote{integration} where these insights are used for sober reconsolidation.

% My strengths lie in thorough systematization of technical content and not in well-flowing prose. I'm sorry if that doesn't work well for you, but it's the best I can do at the moment. This was also my first significant writing project and I had to teach myself how to write. If it's too dense, please feel free to upload it to Claude and ask it to interpret it for you. I tried it and thought the accuracy was excellent.

% Multiple psychedelic-therapy training programs exist for mental health professionals but typical therapist education often contains major oversights, and we strongly suspect psychedelic-therapy training programs do too. These programs are also locked behind paywalls. There are various solo MDMA therapy guides that, while offering some valuable advice, are also full of poor-quality information and fail to adequately discuss safety risks. We attempt to fill the niche of accessible and practically applicable recommendations backed by rigorous scientific research, professional therapist experience, and strict ethical guidelines. Our experiences with the failure of the mental health treatment system help us tailor this document to the complex nuances of real situations. 

% The process of memory reconsolidation has the potential to heal not just mental illness, but a wide range of maladaptive patterns ranging from the implicit biases partially driving some toxic politics, to insecurity, escapism, disconnection, and more. Traditional psychotherapy strongly relies on the client finding a practitioner they match well with, is expensive, has trouble making progress in the presence of strong resistance, dissociation, or panic, has significant drop-out rates, and frequently doesn't work. The psychedelic-therapy renaissance has emerged partly as a response to these challenges. While we believe a variety of psychedelics have positive roles to play in therapy, we focus on MDMA because of our personal experience and MDMA's relative ease of use for those with trauma.

% My goal is for this document to be a comprehensive overview and self-contained starting point, including scientific descriptions of the core concepts and brief tutorials on a variety of related practices. Links to in-depth resources are provided for those wanting to dig deeper. This document aims to describe how the mind responds to trauma and how healing works, in a way that is hopefully clear, accurate, and directly applicable to healing. I hope you find it of use.

\section{Why MDMA Therapy is Important and How this Manual Helps}
Mental illness is one of the largest causes of suffering \cite{mentalhealthpriority}. Besides being painful, difficult, and expensive for the people who experience it, it carries a heavy economic, emotional, and logistical cost for close companions of those who experience it. We also hypothesize that the widespread prevalence of mental illness effects, such as cognitive distortion and emotional rigidness, partially drives tribalism and political polarization across the globe. Even when mental illness isn't a factor in tribalism, we hypothesize that the learned maladaptive and false beliefs that are key components of humanity's tribal tendencies \cite{klein2020Polarized,galefScoutMindset} can be deliberately unlearned by the same mechanism that mental illness can be unlearned. While some individuals can access effective mental healthcare, both access and effectiveness are inadequate for most of the vast population of individuals who experience mental illness.

We are developing an evidence-based user guide to therapeutic MDMA use. Therapeutic use of MDMA is one of the most promising developments in psychopharmacology \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}. This guide has the potential to meaningfully reduce mental illness by addressing several of the most prevalent, highest-impact barriers to effective care. By doing this, we hope to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item alleviate direct suffering
	\item assist individuals in building their capacity to function effectively in the world
	\item increase the ability of individuals to feel and behave compassionately toward all beings
\end{itemize}

Ultimately, we believe this has the potential to improve the capacity of entire communities to act collaboratively towards constructive ends. We believe this guide provides the foundational knowledge necessary to leverage MDMA to create transformative increases in compassion and connectedness, relevant to many positive social outcomes as well as to mental healthcare. This project aims to amplify the broad-scale effectiveness of therapeutic MDMA use by helping overcome three categories of barriers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Trust:} Feelings of trust towards the therapeutic process are an important resource for getting individuals into mental health treatment who need it, and feelings of trust between therapists and clients are an essential mechanism for the effectiveness of therapy \cite{wampoldCommonFactors}. One of the most exciting aspects of therapeutic MDMA usage is that it allows traumatized individuals to experience a sense of safety and connectedness that is otherwise physiologically and psychologically inaccessible to them, even in trustworthy circumstances \cite{fedduciaMDMAMemoryReconsolidation}. Additionally, many cultures and subcultures experience a normalized hostility regarding even the acknowledgement of mental illness, creating a challenge for clients needing care and for clinicians who attempt to provide effective care in these communities. It can also be extremely difficult for individuals of a particular identity group to feel trust towards a clinician who shares few of their identities and little of their direct experience. Because of this, the ability to achieve that trust more reliably with the support of MDMA may be an enormous asset in increasing the accessibility of effective care. Because of its emphasis on rigor and accessibility, the guide we are producing has the potential to increase the comfort of a wide variety of individuals who would not otherwise be willing to use MDMA and the comfort of a wide variety of clinicians who would not otherwise be willing to support them.
    \item \textbf{Financial and logistical:} We believe MDMA is useful for increasing cost-effectiveness for many clients. This can happen through increased efficiency of therapy---it has already shown promise in clinical trials for treating cases resistant to conventional methods. It can also happen through gradually shifting a large amount of therapeutic work to at-home sessions the client conducts by themselves or with a \enquote{sitter} who needs far less training than a fully licensed clinician, if such a method is found to be safe and effective within certain parameters. Some underground practitioners we know report success with this, and it has also been reported by \textcite{colbertEvenings,hillsSolo}. We hope MDMA-assisted psychotherapy will make significant improvements to the cost/quality curve of psychotherapy.
    \item \textbf{Clinician training:} In our professional experience, many licensed clinicians lack access to the best and most up-to-date training because of financial barriers. Additionally, because MDMA usage is and has long been illegal, clinicians who ask their supervisors and senior colleagues about how to support this form of clinical work are often rebuffed. Many clinicians are unwilling to provide clinical support to individuals who embark on its therapeutic use on their own due to this lack of training and support, as well as due to the legal ambiguities of such care. Depending on how flexible the FDA rules for clinical support are when and if MDMA is legalized, it is possible that providing a quality open-access manual at this early stage of the legalization process could have a positive impact on the culture of mental health providers around MDMA support. This has the potential to prevent rent-seeking experts from making an expensive certification the standard in clinical MDMA support before widespread access to therapeutic MDMA can even be established.
\end{itemize}

We are writing a rigorous, comprehensive, and accessible guide to therapeutic MDMA use. It starts with a clear exposition on the science of trauma and healing, articulating a proposed mechanism by which MDMA therapy most likely achieves its effectiveness. It continues on to a thorough discussion of the practice of MDMA therapy, covering safety, dosage, what to expect physically and psychologically, and the role of clinical support. This includes discussion of complicating factors such as addiction, poly-drug use, and contraindications. We have included detailed instructions on using MDMA to confront the painful and self-defeating feelings that underlie a wide range of implicit social biases. Finally, we include a discussion of therapies and therapeutic supports appropriate for augmenting MDMA therapy, as well as several appendices of supplementary resources to assist therapeutic MDMA users in getting the most out of their experience.

Many people are already doing professionally guided or solo MDMA therapy outside legal frameworks \cite{hillsSolo,passieHistory}. The available information on the subject for these professionals, their clients, and DIYers is usually poor quality, locked behind expensive training programs, or both. Often the institutions providing training advocate for a mix of evidence-based and non-evidence-based practices, which requires that individuals who wish to take an evidence-based approach must do extensive research on their own. Our manual will provide a much-needed source of high-quality, accessible information on this subject. This can increase the accessibility and quality of MDMA therapy and decrease its risks.

\item \textbf{Sleep:} Adequate sleep likely helps with session productivity and post-session recovery \cite{simon2020sleep}. People commonly experience up to three days of post-session fatigue \cite{liechtiGender}. Starting another session before you have recovered from the previous one may reduce session effectiveness and increase the risk of undesirable effects.

\item \textbf{Tolerance:} Tolerance to MDMA starts developing within 1--2 hours of ingestion and is a primary reason the effects decline much faster than MDMA's plasma concentration \cite{farreTolerance,parrottTolerance}. We have been unable to find any data showing how long it lasts, and distinguishing the effects of tolerance from immobility, avoidance, or the natural variation of sessions may be difficult. We suggest spacing sessions further apart or reducing the dose if you notice a pattern of diminishing effects. Using higher and higher doses to overcome tolerance will produce negative effects.

Transient increases in systolic blood pressure to above 180 mmHg occurred in 5\% of users in one study \cite{vizeliActuteEffects}.

 This is a common and often unavoidable phase of therapy for those with severe trauma. Unfortunately, people are sometimes not explicitly aware they have gone through severe trauma. This may happen if the trauma takes the form of non-secure attachment, abuse is explained away as cultural tradition or \enquote{how things are,} the trauma took place in the period of childhood amnesia, or it is not remembered for another reason. Diagnosis of mental illness likely indicates higher risk as well.
    
    MDMA-assisted therapy tends to speed up both healing and destabilization. Destabilization is sometimes overwhelming and can cause major problems when poorly managed or entered into at an inappropriate moment in your life. It may also, on rare occasion, exacerbate or trigger dangerous symptoms like psychosis or suicidal behavior.

    % \item co-use with other psychiatric medications. This is unlikely to be dangerous but may increase side effects or decrease (SSRIs in particular) the therapeutic effect.

Here is a summary of the most common or significant risks in therapeutic contexts, which we go into further detail later:

    \item conceivably, poorly understood or rare interactions with certain health conditions. Consult a doctor and bring the MAPS pharmaceutical investigator's brochure (\textcite{mapsInvestigatorBrochure}) with you for them to review.

 In the face of this uncertainty, take extra care to find your minimum effective dose, possibly skip booster doses, and minimize co-use of caffeine when doing more than a handful of sessions. Antioxidant supplements may help as well; see \textcite{baggottSupplements}.

 \writtenByDay{
When applying scientific studies to your life and health, it is important to remember that the data we glean from these studies flattens a wide variety of individual responses by combining them into readable averages. You as an individual may experience something very different from the average participant of any given study, and that may be totally normal and fine. Some examples include: you may be much more or less sensitive to the psychological or physical impacts of MDMA. The medicine may impact you for a greater or lesser amount of time than it impacts the average person. You may experience more healing, faster, than the average study participant, or you may not be helped by MDMA at all. Many normal human variations, like low or high body weight, recent pregnancy, or menstrual cycle status, clearly have an impact on many mental health interventions (especially when it comes to effective dosage) but are not typically studied at all.

One of the great frustrations of mental healthcare research is that every real-life situation is infinitely complex, and a corresponding infinity of confounding factors have the potential to influence outcomes. We encourage you to discuss with your clinician any difference in what you are experiencing (during any mental health intervention) from what the average response is that you might have expected from the research. It's important to keep an eye on any health and safety concerns that might be related to your response. Also remember that the range of normal and healthy responses to any mental health intervention is much broader than the averages suggest.
}

    Possession of multiple doses may be risky for those with severely impaired impulse control. Some people use MDMA as an escape, an immediate drug-based solution that doesn't require a therapy component, or don't understand the need to recover between sessions. They may use too high of doses, use it too frequently, or use it in unsafe contexts.

You may attempt to shift the content of your sessions from escapism to engagement with maladaptive schemas if you're addicted and can't stop. That would make the sessions less rewarding and facilitate improved mental health, which might even help with the addiction.

 % A similar study using a different set of categories found that those with adverse symptoms from psychedelics had: sense of social disconnection (72\% of study participants who reported adverse symptoms), anxiety and panic attacks (68\%), existential struggle (65\%), feelings of depression (61\%), derealization (55\%), diminished self-esteem (50\%), depersonalization (37\%), sleep problems or nightmares (35\%), difficulty with thinking clearly (33\%), paranoia (21\%), visual hallucinations/disturbance (21\%) \cite{robinson2024investigation}.

     \item identifying destabilization and helping their client manage it. See \cref{sec:complex,sectionManagement}.

% Further, we're not sure where accurate contradictory evidence for Deidentification or Reduced Precision-Weighting of Social Priors could ever come from. All socially/relationally-relevant priors really are to some degree unreliable and historically contingent. The fields of physics and predictive processing both have extremely rigorous arguments that what is commonly called the self is just some complicated loop of priors and perception, or other information-processing structure\footnote{We don't have any solution to the hard problem of consciousness, and are not making any metaphysical claims about what a \enquote{fundamental} self might be \cite{hardProblem}.}.

% Perhaps a mystical experience of equally profound and inviolable evil could reconsolidate fundamental safety, if such an experience is even possible. M.G. has had intense schemas along the lines of \enquote{existence is fundamentally evil,} but the \enquote{I have a well of inviolable safety} reconsolidates the former, and not the other way around when the two are juxtaposed. Maybe it would work the other way around if their \enquote{existence is fundamentally evil} schema was even more mystical-feeling.

With sufficient exposure to this state, the individual models the attention-modulation pattern with a new set of second-order priors.

With sufficient attention to the perception, the individual models the attention-modulation pattern with a new set of second-order priors.

 The individual might perceive this perspective as accurate and important and, with sufficient attention to this perspective, model it with a new set of second-order priors. Perhaps something like \enquote{all socially or relationally relevant priors are unreliable or historically contingent,} or \enquote{all priors predicting fear, anger, or sadness in non-threatening contexts are unreliable.}

Complex childhood trauma typically creates a limited set of core maladaptive beliefs that are adapted into numerous individual maladaptive schemas. Each one must be 

Here is a, perhaps, reasonably accurate metaphore for the process: Think of the maladaptive schemas as a giant ball of knotted strings. A handful of strings are your core maladaptive beliefs. Your traumatic childhood experiences created these core maladaptive beliefs and wove them together. Your life circumstances and existence are other strings. Your

In the absence of MDMA-specific advice, the cardiologist Nicole Bhave, MD offers this general advice for what type of chest pain you should go to the emergency room for \cite{chestPain}:
\begin{quotation}
    \ldots it most often boils down to the severity of the pain and the heart attack symptoms we mentioned above. If the pain is so severe that you feel like you can't function, or if you are experiencing central or left-sided chest pain---especially if you have nausea or a cold and clammy feeling alongside it---it is always safest to go to the emergency room. With chest pain, it's best to be cautious.
\end{quotation}

MDMA has additional risks with high-cumulative or high-frequency use when using high doses. Somewhere between 250 and 950 lifetime sessions is sufficient to cause valvular heart disease \cite{droogmans2007valvular,tagen2023valvular}. A phenomenon known as \enquote{losing the magic}, where MDMA stops working for unclear reasons, is associated with higher doses and high-frequency use \cite{farreTolerance,parrottTolerance}. A number of higher dose sessions might also cause long-term cognitive impairment \cite{corayMemory}.

We recommend that everyone doing more than a handful of MDMA therapy sessions take extra precautions to reduce the risk of these issues: reducing the dose to your \enquote{minimum effective dose,} eliminating co-use with other drugs suspected to 

Once you have established an effective MDMA therapy routine and have a good sense of how your sessions feel and produce durable therapeutic improvement, you might reduce your total dose by 10\% each session until you notice sessions becoming less helpful. Judge this a few weeks after the session, after the afterglow is finished (see \cref{afterglow}), and you have stabilized to a new baseline. This small reduction is unlikely to waste a valuable session by making it completely ineffective. You can also always return to your previous dose in the current session with an additional small booster.

Like with many drugs, it is worthwhile experimenting to find the minimum effective dose of MDMA when planning more than a handful of sessions. 

Likewise, we also strongly suggest that, when using MDMA frequently or long-term, you experiment to see if you really need a booster dose. In our experience, the single initial dose often provides enough working time to get you to the therapy hangover limit. If therapy hangover is the limiting factor, then a higher dose may not help much.

    Notably, the plants Peganum harmala (Syrian rue) \cite{herraizRue} and Banisteriopsis caapi \cite{ruffell2020pharmacological}, either of which is an essential component of the psychedelic mixture ayahuasca, contain reversible MAOIs. These are shorter acting and 

Additionally, as detailed in \cref{sec:safety}, extremely high cumulative amounts of MDMA can cause valvular heart disease and possibly long-term cognitive effects \cite{corayMemory}. Furthermore, MDMA eventually loses its effects for some people (\enquote{losing the magic}) \cite{farreTolerance,parrottTolerance}. The reasons and prevalence are unclear, though it's associated with higher or more frequent doses.

 if the subsequent dose is reduced in strength to account for reduced CYP2D6 enzyme capacity \todo{what about tolerance?}. \cite{liechtiInteractions} suggests up to a 25\% dose reduction for people with low CYP2D6 capacity. 

     \item \textbf{Medication:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Propranolol may stop some physical symptoms (though not the underlying schemas) of arousal and fight-or-flight \cite{steenenPropranalol}.
        \item Naltrexone may stop the physical symptoms (though not the underlying schemas) of opioid-mediated states like immobility and freezing \cite{escamilla2023treatment}.
        \item Kava reduces anxiety \cite{Pittler03kava}. Side effects when used for less than 24 weeks are mild, infrequent, and transient. Longer-term efficacy and safety are poorly studied.
        \item Prescription psychiatric medication is outside our scope of knowledge to cover. Check whether your medicine is compatible with MDMA before doing another session (see \cref{sec:safety}). Note that there is very little high-quality evidence on the safety and efficacy of long-term use of prescription psychiatric medication \cite{leuchtDecline}. Studies generally only investigate short-term use.
    \end{itemize}

        \item There are many prescription sleep medications outside the scope of this book. Check whether your medicine is compatible with MDMA before doing another session (see \cref{sec:safety}). Note that there is very little high-quality evidence on the long-term safety and efficacy of prescription psychiatric medication \cite{leuchtDecline}.

 However, MDMA experiences are (in)famously difficult to control. Easing in might be more feasible without MDMA. We think MDMA tends to be more destabilizing than conventional therapy.

  Psychedelics, possibly including MDMA, also change the coupling between brain activity and blood flow \cite{padawerNeurovascularCoupling}.

 Psychedelics can also inflate feelings of meaning, potentially biasing respondents to report that their experiences were more valuable than they actually were \cite{hartogsohn2018meaning}.

  because psychedelic experiences can incite a wide variety of mutually exclusive beliefs and amplify feelings of meaning \cite{hartogsohn2018meaning}.

Psychedelics can imbue a variety of experiences and beliefs with feelings of profound meaning \cite{hartogsohn2018meaning}. Unfortunately, we sometimes interpret these experiences as objective truth, when in reality they may be some complex mixture of MDMA-induced sensations, accurate insights, inaccurate insights, your existing beliefs about the world, and beliefs you are aware of but may not have previously held \cite{mcgovern2024integrated}. We suggest investigating these beliefs with your more reliable tools of discernment: compassion, skepticism, and high-quality evidence. Other tools of discernment, cognitive and emotional flexibility, will gradually improve as you continue reconsolidating more maladaptive schemas and the number of things to be afraid of decreases. Use these to rigorously and critically engage with a diverse and challenging set of high-quality information and experiences.

 One small, uncontrolled study of psilocybin-assisted therapy for people with bipolar II but not currently in a hypomanic state showed good efficacy and safety when combined with a high level of support \cite{aaronsonBipolarII}. We aren't sure how well that translates to MDMA therapy.

    
    If that is true, the chain of events might look like something like this:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Psychedelics temporarily either create sensory artifacts or make existing sensory artifacts, which the brain typically filters out, available to conscious awareness.
        \item The brain then associates a terrifying psychedelic experience with pre-existing but typically unnoticed sensory artifacts or builds an overly-strong set of schemas modelling the previously-not-existing sensory artifacts\footnote{Existing anxiety makes the brain more likely to associate new experiences with anxiety \cite{berghSelfEvidencing}, increasing the risk of HPPD for those with very deep anxiety. Terrifying experiences with classic psychedelics may rarely still be sufficient to create essentially PTSD with HPPD as a symptom even in the relatively psychologically healthy \cite{evans2023extended}.}.
        \item The set of schemas modeling these sensory artifacts as a threat, and which drive hypervigilance to the threat, are resistant to natural reconsolidation for the same reasons many other maladaptive schemas are resistant to reconsolidation.
    \end{enumerate}
    Presumably they can also be resolved like other somatic symptoms.

We are not aware of any research comparing the effects of session frequency. People have success with session frequencies anywhere from once every two weeks (M.G.'s experience) to every 6 weeks in the MAPS trials \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial,mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}, to much more infrequently. The following was written assuming the goal of healing as fast as possible while minimizing side effects, financial costs, and logistical costs.

 We suggest stopping recreational use to maintain efficacy for future therapeutic needs if you are reliant on MDMA for therapeutic progress.

, one of which is psychosis. We have heard two reliable anecdotes of high-dose psilocybin trips done the day after an MDMA therapy session causing psychotic episodes. This is unsurprising given that high doses and frequent use of a wide range of psychoactive drugs are well-established risk factors \cite{drugsPsychosis}.

Adequate sleep likely helps with session productivity and post-session recovery \cite{simon2020sleep}. 

By default, it is a racemic (equal) mixture of the R-MDMA and S-MDMA enantiomers (right- and left-handed versions of a molecule), though it is possible to purify either enantiomer, and they have different effects \cite{straumann2024racemic}. 

 You're probably now among the most mentally healthy and in touch with reality 1\% of the global population. If none of the items in any of those lists bring up even a hint of avoidance, disconnection, fear, or anger, congratulations! 

  We recommend the assistance of an ethical, well-matched, and skilled therapist for anyone who develops a pattern of harmful, escapist, or addictive MDMA use. If someone is unable to stop, it may help to shift the content of the sessions from escapism to engagement with maladaptive schemas. That would make the sessions less rewarding and facilitate improved mental health, which might even help with the addiction.


        
        It is important to note that possession of MDMA is a felony in most of the world, though in practice many jurisdictions do not enforce or prioritize charges for possession of small amounts \cite{alphaLegalization}.

Even if you aren't taking any medications, the precautionary principle might suggest spacing sessions far enough apart to allow recovery, perhaps a week or two at minimum.

The degree of danger is unclear and dependent on a drug's degree of inhibition and dose. 

We recommend doing additional research for other serious health conditions.

% You can use the concept of half-lives to plan discontinuation if your medication isn't on one of those lists, you can't access a doctor or pharmacist, and you can temporarily discontinue it safely and with tolerable effects. One half-life is the time it takes for a drug's concentration in your body to decrease by half\footnote{Each drug has a different half-life, which can be found on \href{https://go.drugbank.com}{DrugBank} under Pharmacology → Metabolism.}. So the concentration would be 50\% after one-half life, 25\% after two, etc. Discontinuing a drug for 5 drug half-lives before the session and 2 days (5 MDMA half-lives) after the session would generally ensure that 98\% of a drug has been excreted from your body \cite{torrePharmacology}. This does not account for health conditions that affect metabolism. You would also need to see if the drug has any active metabolited and look at their half lives. On rare occasions a drug's relevant effects persist even after it has been totally eliminated from your body, as is the case with SSRIs, SNRIs, and MAOIs. When restarting a medication after using MDMA, it's also important to account for CYP2D6 inhibition, as described below. Additionally, some medications require tapering.

 Olanzapine and risperidone seem much more effective than chlorpromazine for LSD-induced psychosis in published case reports. 

 In one study, a combination of high ambient temperature (30 °C / 86 °F), untreated hyperthyroidism, and 2 mg/kg MDMA increased the core temperature of rats by 2 °C (3.6 °F) \cite{shokryHyperthyroidism}. This effect did not occur at lower ambient temperature (22 °C / 72 °F) or in rats with normal thyroid function.

 That may not be a complete list of cardiovascular conditions contraindicated for MDMA.

 \footnote{Doses around the high end of this range don't cause long-term cognitive impairment when used a handful of times \cite{mithoeferSafety}, but there is concern that a number of higher-dose sessions can cause that issue \cite{corayMemory}.}

 \todo{Does this ever actually happen outside extremely rare circumstances circumstances involving multiple cardiovascular-influencing drugs + cardiovascular disease? \textcite{makunts2023concomitant}}

 , and may on rare occasion also cause other cardiovascular issues in people with cardiovascular disease \cite{mapsInvestigatorBrochure}

 Severe hyponatremia on MDMA is caused by drinking exceedingly large amounts of water exceeding sweat and urine losses, and is therefore easily avoided \cite{riggDeaths}.

 \subsection{When to Seek Emergency Care}
NOTE: I feel that this subsection is not useful. Following the MAPS recommendations for cardiovascular events would have people rushing off to the ER all the time. I also don't know enough to make the hyponatremia guidelines useful.

As previously discussed, most of the interactions that can cause severe acute harm are known and can be avoided with proper precautions or by avoiding using MDMA \cite{wolfgang2025,riggDeaths}. However, individuals may not always follow proper precautions or may not have had certain health conditions diagnosed. We have largely been unable to find an MDMA-specific set of recommendations for when to seek emergency care. However, the direct causes of severe acute damage involving MDMA are mostly high body temperature or hyponatremia \cite{riggDeaths} and rarely cardiovascular events \cite{mapsInvestigatorBrochure}. Because of this, we list what symptoms of those conditions one should generally seek emergency care for here:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Heat Stroke:} Body temperature over 40 °C (104 °F) is a medical emergency \cite{morris2023heatstroke}. Other symptoms include confusion, ataxia (loss of control of body movement), delirium, or seizures. As discussed above, this can be caused by serotonin syndrome, extended physical activity in high temperatures combined with dehydration, exceedingly high doses, or combining MDMA with hyperthyroidism in high ambient temperature. MDMA normally increases body temperature by 0.3°C (0.5 °F) in therapeutic contexts \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial}. It also has side effects not associated with increases in body temperature, include sweating, feeling cold, and feeling hot \cite{liechtiGender}.
    \item \textbf{Severe Hyponatremia:} Symptoms of hyponatremia (not necessarily severe hyponatremia) include anorexia, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, headache, muscle cramps, altered mental status, agitation, seizures, and coma \cite{mohottige2019hypovolemic}. Distinguishing these symptoms from the side effects of MDMA might be difficult since MDMA can also cause nausea, vomiting, and appetite suppression \cite{liechtiGender}. Therapeutically appropriate defense cascade activation can also cause agitation, fatigue, and sleepiness \cite{kozlowskaDefenseCascade}. Mild hyponatremia is common on MDMA with unrestricted water access \cite{atilaHyponatremia}, is not a significant problem, and resolves within a few hours after the cessation of water intake \cite{baggottWater}.
    \item \textbf{Cardiovascular Events:} MDMA therapy occasionally causes non-cardiac chest pain \cite{colcott2024side}. The cardiologist Nicole Bhave, MD offers this general advice for what type of chest pain you should go to the emergency room for \cite{chestPain}:
    \begin{quotation}
        \ldots it most often boils down to the severity of the pain and the heart attack symptoms we mentioned above. If the pain is so severe that you feel like you can't function, or if you are experiencing central or left-sided chest pain---especially if you have nausea or a cold and clammy feeling alongside it---it is always safest to go to the emergency room. With chest pain, it's best to be cautious.
    \end{quotation}
    MDMA's side effects also include nausea, feeling cold, and sweating, adding difficulty to distinguishing MDMA's symptoms from a heart attack. MAPS has these recommendations for what to do about potential symptoms of stroke or heart attack during MDMA therapy: \enquote{Any symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, neurological deficit or confusion[, or] other potential indicators of end organ effects of hypertension should prompt additional vital sign measurements and intervene [sic] if appropriate} \cite{mapsInvestigatorBrochure}.
\end{itemize}

 If you are worried about your potential for addiction or have significantly impaired impulse control, we suggest only possessing one dose at a time and only obtaining MDMA from a trusted mental health professional who can monitor your abuse potential.
    
    If someone is unable to stop, it may help to shift the content of the sessions from escapism to engagement with maladaptive schemas. That would make the sessions less rewarding and facilitate improved mental health, which might even help with the addiction.

It's important to not mix MDMA with some substances of abuse, and certain major withrawal symptoms may also be dangerous to mix with MDMA therapy.

Research into the clinical use of MDMA is still relatively new, and 

Putting this in perspective, one panel of drug-misuse experts estimated that MDMA poses a significantly lower overall health risk than marijuana and far less than alcohol \cite{nuttDrugHarms}. That's even in recreational contexts where users are likely not as cautious as they should be of risks. However, as detailed in \cref{sec:complex}, anyone with mental illness undergoing MDMA therapy has a higher chance of destabilization than the average recreational user. Combining unusual states of consciousness, the physiological effects of MDMA, possibly intense trauma reactions, activation or deactivation of defense cascade states, and psychogenic illness might also unpredictably impact a wide variety of conditions.

 Unless otherwise specified, MDMA is an equal mixture of the right- and left-handed versions of the molecule \cite{straumann2024racemic}.

High-quality analysis of adulterants and dosage can only be done with sophisticated laboratory equipment. \textcite{testingLabs} maintains a list of testing laboratories. It is also straightforward to test for the presence of many common adulterants at home using reagent kits \cite{reagentInstructions}. \textcite{testKitSuppliers} maintains a list of reagent kit suppliers. However, it is not possible to accurately measure the quantity or concentration of MDMA and various fillers, binding agents, and adulterants at home. Unregulated pills rarely specify how much MDMA they contain, and it's always mixed with fillers, binders, and dyes. Loose crystals are often, but not always, fairly pure MDMA. Some vendors will package measured amounts of crystals into capsules.

 \textcite{baggottSupplements} summarizes the existing research on this topic and offers some personal recommendations.

     \item \textbf{Adulterants:} Unregulated pills marketed as MDMA/ecstasy/molly can contain harmful adulterants or different amounts of MDMA than were advertised \cite{saleemiAdulterants}.

\footnote{See \cref{ssriRetraction} explaining why we cite this retracted study.}

    \item \textbf{Unknowns:} MDMA, like many medicines, may have uncommon, poorly understood side effects, particularly after long-term, high-frequency use or in populations with certain genetic features or medical conditions.

A good clinician will collaboratively make a plan with you that accounts for the role a drug plays in your life and interactions with underlying medical conditions. When pausing or temporarily reducing the dose, they would time the duration to balance the tradeoffs between withdrawal and interactions with MDMA.

\footnote{The half life is 7.6--10 hours in 95\% of healthy individuals but can range from 4.6--16 hours in healthy people \cite{straumann2024racemic}.}

 Note that exceptionally high doses might move a low- to medium-risk interaction to a high-risk interaction.

No generally high-risk interactions apart from MAOIs and lithium have yet been identified. However, some may increase low- to moderate-risk effects. Refer to \textcite{sarparastDrugInteractions,liechtiInteractions,spiritMemberProgram} for drug-specific information and recommendations.

    \item \textbf{Drugs Associated with Increased Risk in Recreational Contexts:} Some drugs are associated with higher mortality in recreational contexts: MDMA metabolites and analogs (adjusted odds ratio of death of 8.7), muscle relaxants (8.2), anesthetics (7.1), amphetamines and stimulants (3.1), benzodiazepines (2.3), opioids (2.1), ethanol (2), and antidepressants (1.6) \cite{cohenMDMADrugCombinations}\footnote{Taken from Table S4, multivariate analysis with binary predictor \cite{cohenMDMADrugCombinations}.}. Mixing some of these drugs with MDMA may be safe in therapeutic contexts, especially when the combination is planned by a doctor or pharmacist. However, this list strongly suggests that additional caution should be used with these combinations.

Combining large doses of other drugs that are metabolized by CYP450 with MDMA may overload one of these metabolic pathways and potentially cause problems.

Some inhibitors, like SSRIs, don't cause dangerous effects when combined with MDMA. 

Mild--moderate adverse effects caused by high serotonin levels may occur via interactions with a variety of other drugs that increase intrasynaptic serotonin or therapeutic doses of MDMA.

Severe serotonin toxicity, called serotonin syndrome, can be deadly.

    High doses of certain antioxidants, including alpha-lipoic acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and acetyl-L-carnitine, administered shortly before and during the session, prevented oxidative stress in rats given high doses of MDMA \cite{aguirre1999alpha,shankaran2001ascorbic,alves2009acetyl}. It's unclear what dose is needed for humans with the doses of MDMA used in therapy.

With the right precautions, MDMA therapy is low risk and well-tolerated by most people, but t

 There have been many flaws in studies on MDMA abuse. Consequently, little is known about what level of use causes physical or psychological problems.

  The LD$_{50}$, the dose at which 50\% of individuals die, is 22 mg/kg in monkeys \cite{ld50}.

 Adequate recovery between sessions should reduce risk.

     \item Taking moderate-high doses of lithium. There is a high risk of seizures.

    \item \textbf{Lithium:} Mixing prescription doses of lithium with classic psychedelics can cause seizures \cite{nayakLithium}. It's conceivable that mixing it with MDMA can also cause seizures, given MDMA's effects on serotonin 5-$HT_{2A}$.

The phase III clinical trials inclusion and exclusion criteria for physical health conditions may suggest a reasonable, though incomplete, starting point \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}. 

. \textcite{højlundGRADE} assessed the quality of the MAPS placebo-controlled MDMA trials for PTSD as \textit{moderate}\footnote{A few small active placebo MDMA trials have also been done \cite{højlundGRADE}. When those were included with the large placebo-control trials the overall GRADE score was downgraded to \textit{low} because GRADE penalizes mixing control types in a single analysis.} using the GRADE\footnote{GRADE is a gold standard in evidence-based medicine.} approach, meaning \enquote{The intervention probably decreases the outcome [PTSD symptoms].}, according to \textcite{neumannGRADE}. None of the authors reported a conflict of interest with MAPS or Resiliant (formerly Lykos), the organizations that conducted the MDMA trials.

\todo{Normal body temp can reach 99F; MDMA might increase it a further 1F in some people; then if the person is processing a panic reaction during therapy that might send it up another 0.5-1F. Would a "higher than 100F" threshold unnecessarily send people to the ER?}

    There isn't much data on which antipsychotics work best for MDMA-induced psychosis \cite{sulstarova2025treatment}. One uncontrolled study found that olanzapine (10--15 mg/day during the first month and 5--10 mg/day during the next 5 months) plus supportive therapy in an outpatient setting was highly effective for severe, prolonged MDMA-induced psychosis, though the lack of a control group limits the conclusions that can be drawn \cite{landabaso2002ecstasy}. 

\subsection{Psychosis}
See also the psychosis bullet point in \cref{psychosis} for further information on psychosis and MDMA.

Like other forms of mental illness, psychosis at least partially consists of overly-strong maladaptive schemas, frequently involving persecution and volatility \cite{sheffield2024understanding}. Unlike most of the other types of issues we discuss, the maladaptive schemas of psychosis are partly caused by \textit{aberrant salience} \cite{corlett2025}. This is a biological issue with the dopamine system whereby normal, unsurprising events frequently create perceptual surprise and prediction error. The brain tries to model these distorted perceptions in the same way normal brains try to model all perception, but frequently surprising perceptions not based external reality are very difficult to model \cite{sheffield2024understanding}. The best-fit model may end up being a hidden actor who controls all these surprising events, e.g., \enquote{the CIA is out to get me and their secret agents keep interfering with my life.}

Schemas also modulate sensory perception \cite{clark2015surfing}. This is mostly adaptive, but can malfunction. Certain unusually strong maladaptive schemas create inaccurate but convincing somatic perceptions, like some types of chronic pain, that do not match external/bodily reality \cite{berghPsychogenic}. Similar processes may presumably also create the complex and inaccurate perceptions involved in psychosis. Unfortunately, these hallucinations may further be perceived as additional evidence for the maladaptive schemas driving that perception \cite{sheffield2024understanding}, creating what looks to us like a self-reinforcing attractor state of psychosis.

Growing up in an actually volatile and persecutory environment would also incentivize the creation of accurate schemas predicting pervasive volatility and persecution. We speculate that this existing mental wiring would make it easier to develop inaccurate schemas about volatility and persecution in late adolescence to early adulthood when psychosis typically first shows up.

Here are the psychosis treatments we know of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item There isn't much data on which antipsychotics work best for MDMA-induced psychosis \cite{sulstarova2025treatment}. One uncontrolled study found that olanzapine (10--15 mg/day during the first month, and 5--10 mg/day during the next 5 months) plus supportive therapy in an outpatient setting was highly effective for severe prolonged MDMA-induced psychosis, though the lack of control group limits the conclusions that can be drawn \cite{landabaso2002ecstasy}.

    \textcite{psychosisTreatment} found that when MDMA and psychedelics were implicated in psychotic episodes, the episode lasted an average of 1.8 ± 4.2 weeks with antipsychotic treatment.
    \item Cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp) has a small-medium effect size \cite{CBTp}.
    \item Reducing stress \cite{winkelPsychosisStress}.
    \item Reducing the dose and frequency of use of unnecessary psychoactive drugs, including cannabis \cite{drugsPsychosis} and caffeine \cite{wang2015caffeine}.
    \item The above theorizing suggests that reconsolidation could improve psychosis depending on the particulars of the case. As detailed in the psychosis bullet point in \cref{psychosis}, we've seen a few anecdotes of people successfully using MDMA therapy for this purpose, but this seems especially risky since it can also cause psychosis. Complex system transitions are difficult to predict.
\end{itemize}

    It is likely worth seeking outpatient psychiatric treatment if MDMA-induced psychosis persists to the next day. Hospitalization is needed if the episode is dangerous. See \textcite{alexanderInpatient} for advice on navigating/avoiding inpatient care. One study found that when MDMA and psychedelics were implicated in psychotic episodes, the episode lasted an average of 1.8 ± 4.2 weeks with antipsychotic treatment \cite{psychosisTreatment}.

    It is likely worth seeking outpatient psychiatric treatment if MDMA-induced mania persists to the next day. Hospitalization is needed if the episode is dangerous. See \textcite{alexanderInpatient} for advice on navigating/avoiding inpatient care.

    As discussed in \cref{suicideCops} (paragraph on involuntary commitment), going to the hospital for suicidality appears to often be counterproductive. It frequently increases the medium-term chances of suicide completion \cite{emanuelHospitalization}.

, even though participants reporting any personal history (family history was allowed) of psychotic disorders were excluded from participation \cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}.

    Destabilization can consist of many different symptoms \cite{evans2023extended}. 

However, MDMA, like most experiences that can make you feel profoundly safe, can be psychologically addictive when it is used to escape from difficult feelings rather than engaging with them. 

    There is a significant difference between using MDMA to engage with difficult emotions vs escaping difficult emotions. Addiction in the first case is unrecorded in clinical trials, and addictions in the latter case are rare.
 It's unclear how this translates to humans.

  The serotonin system hasn't recovered yet so this spacing risks oxidative stress \cite{} and therefore might be reserved for exceptional circumstances of unbearable destabilization that don't respond to other treatments.

  First, it takes about 4 days to recover from the post-acute fatigue and side effects \cite{liechtiGender}. The serotonin system hasn't recovered yet so this spacing risks oxidative stress \cite{} and therefore might be reserved for exceptional circumstances of unbearable destabilization that don't respond to other treatments. 

   The \enquote{three-month rule} was one semi-educated guess for this.

    % \item High quality sleep is likely important for reconsolidation~\cite{simon2020sleep}. We recommend a highly effective evidence-based protocol called \textit{cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia} if you struggle getting quality sleep~\cite{trauerCBTI}. Stanford Medicine has a guide~\cite{stanfordSleep}.

    \item We think thought records are an excellent mental health and memory reconsolidation tool that can be used alone or with a clinician. If you are interested, we recommend completing at least one before your first medicine session, to familiarize yourself with the process and support yourself in making optimal use of this tool afterward, during your integration period. See \textcite{harperThought} for a worksheet.

Both MDMA phase III clinical trials reported that MDMA-assisted non-directive psychotherapy highly outperformed placebo-with-therapy treatments for PTSD~\cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial,mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}. Phase III is the final round of clinical trials that test efficacy and safety on a large sample size; 174 total participants in this case.

The greater effect size in CAPS-5 compared to SDS may reflect the fact that many participants had complex trauma. Targeting a single trauma in therapy will improve those specific symptoms to a greater degree than the client's overall symptoms, which are caused by multiple or complex traumas. 

The first phase III study reported a Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) effect size of $d = 0.91$ with $p < 0.0001$, and the second reported $d = 0.7$ with $p < 0.001$. Those numbers indicate large effect sizes. CAPS-5 scores represent therapeutic progress related to the single traumatic event that participants chose as their therapeutic target. However, another measurement collected in the studies, the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), also reported large gains in total life functionality independent of progress related to that single traumatic event. The first trial reported $d = 0.43$ with $p = 0.0116$, and the second reported $d = 0.4$ with $p = 0.03$.

When those were included with the large placebo-control trials the overall GRADE score was downgraded to \textit{low} because GRADE penalizes mixing control types in a single analysis.} GRADE\footnote{GRADE is a gold standard in evidence-based medicine.} quality)~\cite{højlundGRADE}

    \item PTSD, as just discussed (11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), total participants (N) = 303, effect size 95\% CI = (0.6--1.1) (medium--very large))~\cite{højlundGRADE}

\textcite{højlundGRADE} pooled all the MDMA therapy trials together and calculated the average effect sizes of MDMA with therapy compared to placebo with therapy, though these calculations don't include some potential biases. It is somewhere between 0.6--1.1 (medium--large) for PTSD symptom reduction (measured for 303 participants) and somewhere between 0.15--0.72 (very small--medium) for functional impairment (measured for 194 participants). Actual effects were larger since that just reports the difference between MDMA and placebo; both involved therapy, which had it's own positive effect. Those ranges are confidence intervals (CI); roughly speaking, there is a 95\% chance that the true average effect is within that range\footnote{This isn't exactly what a confidence interval means, but the technically accurate definitions are mostly confusing and useless.}. Confidence intervals convey the statistical precision of studies. Individuals will also have a range of responses surrounding the average.

See \textcite{wolfgang2025,icerReport} for a more thorough discussion of efficacy. 

% We suspect reconsolidation would significantly improve everything in HiTOP (\hyperref{hitop-system.org/current-model}) except some chemical addictions, some thought disorders, and some other odds and ends.

As previously mentioned, mental illness is a complex interaction of biology (genes and medical history), psychology (schemas, attention/avoidance), and social context~\cite{engel1977need}. We think reconsolidation can likely resolve the \textit{psycho} part of \textit{biopsychosocial}~\cite{carhart2019rebus,eckerUnlocking}, which we suspect plays a major part in the majority of mental illness cases.  For instance, the current categorization of mental illness in the DSM and ICD-CDDR are self-admittedly in large part just semi-arbitrary clustering of different symptoms~\cite{apaDSM,ICD}. They mostly do not attempt to determine causes.

However, there is a great deal of controversy and confusion over certain aspects of those trials and whether the FDA was correct in not approving MDMA therapy until more data is gathered \textcite{evansBlame}.

The Food and Drug Administration's response letter (\textcite{crl}) lists the reasons they did not approve it.

Trials for all mental health interventions rarely control for expectancy of good results among participants and researchers, one type of study bias that placebos are supposed to correct for~\cite{hunekeExpectancy}. This results in much of the field using poor-quality data that doesn't properly differentiate how much of the treatment effect is due to study bias vs. the intrinsic effects of the treatment itself. This most obviously impacts trials where blinding is impossible, like psychotherapy and mindfulness. However, it also affects trials that attempt blinding but where the effect of the medicine is noticeable enough that the patients or providers unblind themselves. After unblinding, the patient's and provider's expectations about whether the drug works then alter either how much the treatment actually works or how much they report that the treatment works. Psychedelic-assisted therapy trials like the MDMA trials possibly have worse-than-typical unblinding and researcher bias compared to typical trials for psychiatric drugs because the effects of psychedelics can be so noticeable~\cite{adayMethodologicalRigor}. \textcite{vanElkMethodology} thoroughly discusses these problems. We still think MDMA therapy is more effective than placebo due to two lines of evidence. First, some anecdotes appear to support durable therapeutic improvement in situations where the user was intending a recreational rather than therapeutic experience but happened to activate some emotional issues. Second, anecdotes of successful MDMA therapy outcomes frequently match the signs of successful therapeutic improvement reported by \textcite{eckerUnlocking}: emotional non-reactivation, symptom cessation, and effortless permanence. \todo{expectancy bias, response bias, attrition bias, co-intervention bias, communication bias, and reporter bias}

Additionally, almost no other psychoactive drug trials have needed blinding assessment and expectancy corrections to be approved~\cite{hunekeExpectancy}

There were three MDMA therapy sessions, each with high levels of pre- and post-session psychological support.

 Preliminary data from the phase III trials \cite{mplongPreliminary}.

e know that some people have enough resources, skill, and slack to use solo MDMA therapy to successfully treat debilitating mental illness. Many more people can use solo MDMA therapy to reconsolidate relatively minor issues. Skilled, ethical, and well-matched professional support is especially desirable for people with significant risk factors for dangerous conditions like suicide, psychosis, and mania. However, we recognize that people sometimes have to make the best of bad situations. Solo MDMA with risk factors might occasionally be a better option than the available alternatives, though this is highly individualized and we can't make any specific recommendations.

 \footnote{As with most coping strategies that people with complex trauma develop, these are neurotic in many aspects of my life. They have been quite helpful here, though.}.

 These models might gradually update away when juxtaposed with contradictory evidence from other priors and sensory input if they are inaccurate. They should be less likely to update away when juxtaposed with other priors or reality if they are an accurate perception. It's also conceivable that they are inaccurate but highly self-reinforcing. We're skeptical of this possibility since avoidance is a critical factor in maladaptive priors sticking around, and internalized MDMA feels good, thus incentivizing anti-avoidance. The people who learn the internalized-MDMA priors are also typically mentally ill and put extremely high amounts of attention on priors and perceptions of danger, which would normally update away many inaccurate safety priors. It's also conceivable that the internalized-MDMA priors were created with such unusually high-precision weighting that no conceivable experience has enough precision to create prediction error. We're also skeptical of this explanation because people have all sorts of profoundly-true-feeling experiences on MDMA that they later come to disbelieve or interpret differently. Thus, we suspect the learned model in large part accurately reflects reality.

You almost certainly did not break your brain unless you combined MDMA with MAOIs or severely overdosed.


    \item Do you think “losing the magic,” accumulated damage in the serotonin system from excessive oxidative stress, and the long-term cognitive decline seen in some observational studies of recreational users are the same phenomenon?


Please comment on the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Do you know what afterglow is neurologically? People commonly report a few-day to few-week long period following MDMA therapy that consists of well-being, positive mood, mindfulness, positive behaviors, and less mental illness. Some people also report that conventional therapy is easier in this period. See \cref{afterglow} for more information.
    \item Do you think “losing the magic,” accumulated damage in the serotonin system from excessive oxidative stress, and the long-term cognitive decline seen in some observational studies of recreational users are the same phenomenon?
    \item Do you know what "therapy hangover" is neurologically? It feels like an odd flavor of mental and physical exhaustion following extended memory reconsolidation, facilitated either by MDMA and conventional therapy. It's a common limiting factor in the productive duration of MDMA therapy and conventional therapy. I haven't been able to find a single mention of it the literature. It seems to resolve in a few hours to a day.

    Here's the microphenomenology for me (and I think others): In an MDMA session I will engage with a fear or anger and it's associated belief (e.g., \enquote{I'm afraid I'll die if no one loves me}). At first, that emotion and belief are crystal clear and strong. After a couple hours of processing different fears I will suddenly feel a wave of mental and physical exhaustion and the fears and beliefs are no longer clear and I can no longer reconsolidate them. I know they're still activated because I still feel vaguely anxious and behave according to those fears. Sometimes the MDMA will \enquote{push} though that exhaustion and I'll get another period of clarity and ability to reconsolidate.

    I don't think this is just the MDMA peak wearing off. The same thing happens in regular sober therapy.

    This type of exhaustion also has a \enquote{spacey} flavor, like I'm also in a slightly altered state of consiousness different from regular exhaustion. My partner who has never done psychedelics reports the same thing after a hard therapy session.
    \item Do you know how long short term tolerance lasts? I haven't been able to find any data.
\end{itemize}


    \item \textbf{Session spacing:} It's difficult to give specific recommendations for session spacing because everyone has a different MDMA therapy risk/reward tradeoff and different bodies respond differently to MDMA. However, we do know some factors worth considering, listed below. They suggest two separate minimum spacings to us. The first spacing is the length of time long afterglow lasts for you (see \cref{afterglow}). Regular reconsolidation exercises, like psychotherapy, might be easier than normal in this period. If that is the case for you, then it likely makes sense to do that rather than more MDMA. It's unclear whether the serotonin and antioxidant systems have recovered yet, so we think this spacing should be reserved for situations of high therapeutic need where you use your minimum effective dose (see \cref{sec:dosing}). The second spacing is the length of time it takes for your tolerance to completely reset, which is best estimate we know of for how long it takes your serotonin and antioxidant\todo{Tolerance seems more related to serotonin restoration. How could anyone tell how long it takes to recover antioxidants?} systems to recover~\cite{baggottSerotonin}. This likely depends on dose and individual varibility, and the average is not known. We think anywhere from 6\,weeks (the phase III trials~\cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}) to 3\,months (community \enquote{three month rule}) is a reasonable starting point.

, like overdosing, heat stroke, severe hyponatremia, and drug mixing

~\cite{straumann2024racemic}\footnote{The half life is 7.6--10 hours in 95\% of healthy individuals but can also range from 4.6--16 hours in some healthy people \cite{straumann2024racemic}.}


    \item \textbf{Alterations in the Serotonin System:} High cumulative use and high frequency use are associated with long term alterations in the brain's serotonin system \cite{farreTolerance,parrottTolerance}.

We have seen many anecdotes of people believing that healthy eating and exercise will protect them from oxidative stress. We have been unable to find any evidence supporting this and do not recommend believing it without further rigorous evidence.


    
    Conversely, daily antioxidant supplements could conceivably downregulate the body's own antioxidant system, leaving it less able to buffer the stress of MDMA. It might be worth stopping regular antioxidant supplementation well before a session, especially since they're rarely useful for much anyway~\cite{bjelakovicAntioxidant}.

your lowest effective dose without a booster. Taking large doses of certain antioxidants shortly before and during the session may help too~\cite{aguirre1999alpha,shankaran2001ascorbic,alves2009acetyl}. Some companies bundle these antioxidants together in commercially available products, like \textcite{rollKit}, but we are not aware of them having been rigorously tested for usefulness in humans. 

However, we do know some factors worth considering, listed below. They suggest two separate minimum spacings to us. The first spacing is the length of time long afterglow lasts for you, if you get it (see \cref{afterglow}). Regular reconsolidation exercises, like psychotherapy, might be easier than normal in this period. If that is the case for you, then it likely makes sense to do that rather than another MDMA session while you are still in afterglow. It's unclear whether the serotonin and antioxidant systems have recovered yet~\cite{baggottDamage}, so we think this spacing should be reserved for situations of high therapeutic need where you also use your minimum effective dose (see \cref{sec:dosing}). The second spacing is the length of time it takes for your tolerance to completely reset, which is best estimate we know of for how long it takes your serotonin and antioxidant\todo{Tolerance seems more related to serotonin restoration. How could anyone tell how long it takes to recover antioxidants?} systems to recover~\cite{baggottSerotonin}. This likely depends on dose and individual varibility, and the average is not known. We think anywhere from 6\,weeks (the phase III trials~\cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2}) to 3\,months (community \enquote{three month rule}) is a reasonable starting point.

    \item Tolerance to MDMA starts developing within 1--2\,hours of ingestion~\cite{farreTolerance,parrottTolerance}. We have been unable to find any data showing how long this lasts. Distinguishing the effects of tolerance from immobility, avoidance, or the natural variation of sessions may be difficult. Space sessions further apart if you notice a pattern of diminishing effects. Using higher doses to overcome tolerance risks undesirable effects like, possibly, long-term cognitive impairment~\cite{corayMemory}.


    \item As detailed in \cref{sec:safety}, a number of higher-dose MDMA sessions may cause long-term cognitive impairment.

\item MDMA eventually loses its effects for some people (\enquote{losing the magic}) in a way that lasts longer than short-term tolerance~\cite{farreTolerance,parrottTolerance}. The mechanism and prevalence are unclear, though it's associated with higher or more frequent doses.

    \item MDMA almost completely inhibits the CYP2D6 liver enzyme that partially metabolizes MDMA~\cite{omathunaCYP}. This enzyme inhibition returns to baseline with a half-life of 47\,hours. Thus, about 2\,days after a session, enzyme activity would be 50\% of the way to baseline, 75\% after 4\,days, 88\% after 6, 94\% after 8, and 97\% after 10. This effect may counteract short-term tolerance or lead to unexpectedly strong reactions to a subsequent dose. % We don't know the consequences of having perpetually-inhibited CYP2D6 from frequent MDMA sessions; the precautionary principle might suggest spacing sessions far enough apart to allow recovery, perhaps a week or two.

 It's conceivable that high cumulative use also causes other, poorly understood issues, particularly for groups of people with certain genetic variants or health conditions.

     \item As detailed in \cref{sec:safety}, extremely high cumulative amounts of MDMA and possibly other psychedelics can cause valvular heart disease. 
    
    \item MDMA therapy frequently causes fatigue the following day~\cite{liechtiGender}, so it's nice to have the following day free for resting.

MDMA commonly causes mild hyponatremia (low plasma sodium concentration) in individuals who drink fluids as desired during the session~\cite{atilaHyponatremia}. We extrapolated from \textcite{baggottWater} that drinking a maximum of 0.5\,L of water during the session would easily prevent hyponatremia. It is also more than sufficient for preventing dehydration in the average person at a comfortable temperature~\cite{valtinWater}. Adding salt to the fluid has not been tested as a solution and is known to not prevent hyponatremia in athletic activities~\cite{hew2008statement}. 

    % \item Major distractions during the session may reduce efficacy~\cite{roseman2024interrupting}. It is helpful to arrange easy access to necessities like a restroom, snacks, and a small amount of (or no) water.

    \item Sessions may be either stabilizing or destabilizing (see \cref{sec:complex}). If you find your sessions consistently destabilizing to a degree that is causing you major problems, waiting longer between sessions may reduce these problems. In this circumstance we also recommend a combination of professional support and proactive self-care strategies like the ones listed in \cref{sectionManagement}. Traditional psychotherapy may be less destabilizing than MDMA therapy. Conversely, another MDMA session conducted after a week- or two-long recovery phase may stabilize you after a particularly destabilizing experience, such as the previous MDMA session. We don't know how to predict when a session will be stabilizing or destabilizing.

 People with a family or personal history of psychosis may benefit from avoiding frequent sessions and using total doses toward the lower end of the effective range. They may also benefit from eliminating or reducing cannabis use, another known risk factor~\cite{drugsPsychosis}.

     \item MDMA therapy sometimes creates an afterglow period of 1--2\,weeks where regular therapy is more effective (see \cref{afterglow}). This is an excellent opportunity to pack in a lot of sober reconsolidation, maybe even maxing out every day (see \cref{sec:moreReconsolidation}). We don't know of many good reasons to do sessions more frequently than this.
    
    \item People commonly experience up to three days of post-session fatigue and other adverse effects~\cite{liechtiGender}. Starting another session before you have recovered from the previous one will likely reduce session effectiveness and increase adverse effects in addition to those previously mentioned.


When your reconsolidation exercises aren't working well. Maintaining a long-term state of afterglow with a three-week frequency might facilitate extraordinarily high amounts of reconsolidation. Given the uncertain risks of high-frequency sessions~\cite{baggottDamage}, we suggest only do them using the precautions outlined in \cref{sec:dosing}. Further, even with those precautions, we think this approach is best used as a limited-duration on-ramp to sober reconsolidation exercises or less frequent MDMA therapy sessions.

\textcite{BRWAIdownload} describes it as \enquote{The bond between client and therapist; the collaborative approach and agreement on treatment goals; the collaborative approach and agreement on treatment tasks.} The quality of the therapeutic alliance is a moderate predictor of the effectiveness of psychotherapy~\cite{fluckiger2018alliance}.

    \writtenByDay{
    \item 
    
    One of the most important aspects of psychological counseling is the therapeutic alliance. While there are adaptive reasons to distrust therapists, there are also maladaptive impediments to forming a healthy therapeutic relationship. MDMA therapy might offer a first foothold in the healing of trauma by reducing transference\footnote{Transference is the attribution of feelings actually about other people and circumstances to the clinician or therapeutic process.} or discomfort that is preventing you from effectively working with a therapist. Thus, one of our concerns about keeping low-frequency MDMA interventions is that this opportunity could be missed, or time could be wasted. A critical mass of support for a briefer period of time can allow someone to become more self-sufficient or able to access community supports. The same amount of support spread out over a greater period of time effectively perpetuates disability.
    }

\textcite{alexanderPrecision} provides a more accessible summary of the paper.


\subsection{Additional Precautions for Higher Frequency or High Cumulative Use}
As discussed later in the Medical Risks subsection, there is a possibility that high doses or frequent sessions gradually cause long-term cognitive impairment~\cite{baggottDamage}. It's unclear what dose and frequency is sufficient to cause this, but it's possible that the above recommended doses can when used frequently.

In the face of this uncertainty, we recommend that anyone planning more than a handful of sessions should find their lowest effective dose. 

    \item Season 1 of \prosecite{powerTrip}.

% To make matters worse, some of the most respected \enquote{above-ground} organizations, such as MAPS, have been accused of participating in this toxic culture by \textcite{powerTrip}. Perhaps worst of all, survivors of abuse or misconduct in the context of PAT have repeatedly been told by respected community leaders that they must keep their silence because they have a responsibility not to detract from the legalization process with demands for accountability. Furthermore, the underground/illegal nature of the endeavor has left survivors with minimal, if any, assistance from the legal system.

 One case of a clinical trial participant reporting a psychotic episode after the trial ended in poorly documented circumstances~\cite{powerTrip}.

     
    The only drugs with less risk were LSD, buprenorphine, and psilocybin. 


    The Dutch State Commission on MDMA found no cases of MDMA addiction in Dutch treatment centers~\cite{netherlandsMDMA}.  These suggest that MDMA use rarely leads to severe addiction. 

That being said, there are reports of MDMA addiction causing problems for people in recreational contexts, though t

 One survey of MDMA users reported that 5\% had tried to reduce their consumption unsuccessfully, though it wasn't reported how much of a problem their MDMA use was creating for them~\cite{GrønnerødNorway}. Many people try to reduce coffee consumption unsuccessfully while also not suffering much harm from their consumption pattern.



While there is some good data on some aspects of dosing, there are missing pieces. This subsection attempts to fill in the gaps between what is known. Unfortunately, this sometimes results in 

\footnote{There isn't a lot of good data on dosing, and different studies use mg/kg or fixed dosing. We tried to piece these data points together the best we could.}

Accurate data on the upper limit of safe doses is unfortunately absent due to difficulties translating the results of animal testing to humans and confounding factors muddying the study of harmful effects in recreational use~\cite{passieHistory}. \textcite{liechtiInteractions}\footnote{M. Liechti, personal communication, December 11, 2025, clarified that 200\,mg is the maximum total dose, not a maximum initial dose. It also only applies to individuals with higher body masses, though specifics weren't mentioned.} recommends a maximum total dose of 200\,mg for the highest body masses.

However, it hasn't been demonstrated that this extends to a larger number of sessions. Therefore, we recommend that anyone planning more than a handful of sessions not use booster doses if possible. Individual circumstances with a different tradeoff between risk and reward may 

This has worked well in the trials. However, \textcite{liechtiInteractions}\footnote{M. Liechti, personal communication, December 11, 2025, clarified that they do not recommend booster doses.} recommends against booster doses, and \textcite{baggottSupplements} recommends a maximum dose of 2 mg/kg, which effectively means no booster for most people. The latter attributes this recommendation to uncertainty about what dose will cause oxidative damage and cognitive impairment.

The primary goal of dosing is matching the strength of MDMA's effects to the the str

Reconsolidation depends on the strength of fear/anger/sadness from the maladaptive schema being somewhat matched to the strength of contradictory evidence~\cite{eckerUnlocking}\footnote{\textcite{eckerUnlocking} states that strength matching isn't very relevant in conventional psychotherapy, but we think it appears to be relevant in MDMA therapy.}. We're not clear to what degree MDMA reduces the strength of maladaptive schemas vs. providing contradictory evidence, but the effect in either case tends in the same direction. 

Long-term cognitive impact is mostly only observed in people who use lots of MDMA at raves over long periods of time~\cite{corayMemory}. 

The rodent studies establish that neurotoxic doses and schedules are possible but do not establish what dose and frequency of dosing cause toxicity in humans~\cite{baggottDamage}.

A span of 3--5 weeks might be enough, since \textcite{mithoeferSafety} didn't find any negative cognitive impact from two sessions at that spacing\footnote{Most studies don't measure more direct markers of oxidative stress, so cognitive function is the next best option. Oxidative stress might not cause cognitive impairment, or if it does, the amount a couple of sessions causes isn't enough to be measurable~\cite{baggottDamage}.}.

For lack of better ideas, the 6\,week spacing used in the phase III trials might be a decent minimum.

 (none of the latter sessions were like this)



    Around hour 1100 I decided to try MDMA again. I was in a particularly tough place and was wondering if I had been wrong about MDMA being redundant with auto-reconsolidation. The session went well. It felt easier to clearly notice what maladaptive schemas were activated, and I have a general, though vague, sense that it was more powerful hour-for-hour than my regular practice.

That experience makes me think the initial inviolable-well-of-safety experience was at least partially a non-dual experience, though it didn't feel like my sense of self was different at the time. I suspect that experience became deeply internalized because it accurately predicted reality in some way. I don't have any metaphysical, ontological, or epistemological insight as to what this means. The initial experience didn't seem sufficient on its own to destabilize my sense of self. That seems to have required re-activating that knowledge for 600\,hours in addition to an existing habit of compulsively monitoring and distrusting my thoughts and self. The latter process seems similar to the insight meditation practices explicitly designed to facilitate shifts to non-dual awareness.

 Sometimes, when that happens, I recall dreaming about my usual fears immediately before waking up.

The interview was informal and didn't use any of the formal bias-reduction techniques often used in qualitative data gathering. 

    I suspect reconsolidation is also happening in dreams on rare occasions. Once in a great while I feel exhausted in a way similar to a therapy hangover when I wake up.


    
    Looking back, the cycling seems like an uncomfortable bump on the road, with neither the old nor new state obviously better than the other. However, that ambivalence might arise from an inability to compare the two stable states, separated by many months, side-by-side. In any case, the auto-reconsolidation capacity is more than valuable enough to have made the distress of this experience easily worth it for me. Also, 

 It contains very little individually original research or insights.






A limited course of MDMA therapy is generally well-tolerated for healthy people, but there are dangerous drug/supplement/herb interactions, medical contraindications, side effects, and psychological risks:

\paragraph{Always avoid:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Taking irreversible MAOIs within 2\,weeks before a session or within a few days after. Also taking reversible MAOIs, like those in ayahuasca, within 2--3\,days before a session. This is potentially deadly.
    \item Extremely high lifetime use of MDMA and psychedelics. Over 250\,tablets risks heart valve disease.
    \item Taking ritonavir or cobicistat or HIV drugs that contain them. This is potentially deadly.
    \item Hyperthyroidism that isn't \enquote{well-managed and mild.}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Use caution with:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Co-use with other psychiatric drugs. This is unlikely to be dangerous but may increase side effects or decrease (SSRIs in particular) the therapeutic effect.
    \item Drinking significantly more than perhaps 0.5\,L of water during the six hours of the session unless you need to replace large amounts of sweat. Drinking as desired, even just lying on a couch in comfortable temperatures, frequently causes mild hyponatremia (low plasma sodium) when on MDMA. Adding electrolytes probably won't help.
    \item A number of higher-dose sessions or high session frequency. There's an unclear possibility that this causes long-term cognitive impairment, though the specifics are unknown. In the face of this uncertainty, take extra care to find your minimum effective dose, possibly skip booster doses, and minimize co-use of caffeine when doing more than a handful of sessions. Antioxidant supplements may help as well; see \textcite{baggottSupplements}.
    \item Existing liver or cardiovascular problems. The risk is unclear. Consult a doctor and bring the relevant section of the MAPS pharmaceutical investigator's brochure (\textcite{mapsInvestigatorBrochure}) with you for them to review.
    \item Unusually high doses. The risk is unclear.
    \item Possibly poorly understood or rare interactions with certain health conditions.
    \item A history of psychosis, mania, or serious amphetamine/cocaine addiction. The risk is high, but it may not be an absolute contraindication.
    \item Adulterated pills. The risk is unclear and varies by adulterant. The presence of some common adulterants can be checked with reagent test kits (\textcite{testKitSuppliers} maintains a list of suppliers). Laboratory testing is much better (\textcite{testingLabs} maintains a list of labs). It measures the amount of MDMA and all other ingredients but is harder to access depending on where you live.
\end{itemize}

Putting this in perspective, one panel of drug-misuse experts estimated that MDMA poses a significantly lower overall health risk than marijuana and far less than alcohol. That's even in recreational contexts where users are likely not as cautious as they should be of risks. However, anyone undergoing MDMA therapy has a higher chance of destabilization than the average recreational user.

Do not use MDMA with any other drug or drug without first establishing that the combination is safe. Consult \textcite{liechtiInteractions} for many interactions with psychiatric drugs.

As an absolute bare minimum, wait a few days to completely recover from the side effects of the last one. A more reasonable frequency is likely somewhere between a few weeks and a few months. If you're on the more frequent end of that spectrum, take extra care to follow the risk-reduction steps listed below in the bullet point about cognitive impairment.

    % A deeper issue of epistemic circularity is fundamentally unavoidable in the healing process and in life in general~\cite{epistemicCircularity}. Reconsolidation changes schemas, but schemas are also the beliefs and actions that prompt you to seek healing in the first place, evaluate whether reconsolidation was helpful, and evaluate whether to continue. The reconsolidation process is not special or unusual in this regard; all experience and action changes the brain, and the changed brain then evaluates those experiences and actions through the changed set of schemas~\cite{clark2015surfing}. The brain/schemas, in their interaction with the world, are ever-changing self-modeling loops of action, perception, prediction, and beliefs. There is no conceivable viewpoint or perspective that is truly objective and from which a process or change can be assessed without bias~\cite{epistemicCircularity}. Professional assistance doesn't resolve this either, because they are their own bundle of schemas, and your schemas are evaluating their trustworthiness.

 A number of licensed therapists and underground psychedelic guides have appeared in the news for boundry violation~\cite{powerTrip}.   

 MDMA adds a source of intense safety, compassion, and connection to a therapeutic session without the strong loss of self, hallucinations, or traumatizing experiences that LSD, DMT, or mushrooms can sometimes create. These emotional states make the engagement and unlearning of maladaptive patterns easier and more productive. MDMA's properties make therapeutic progress simpler than traditional psychotherapy. People often make major therapeutic progress when all they do is take the medicine in a relatively safe environment and emotionally (not just intellectually) engage with maladaptive beliefs or trauma responses. A therapeutic framework (e.g., CBT or IFS) or a highly attuned therapist is not necessary. However, a structured and safe container definitely increases the chances of benefit and reduces risk. Most obviously, this container includes skilled, ethical, and well-matched professional assistance in addition to preparatory and follow-up sessions. MDMA's capacity for powerful and rapid therapeutic progress is also associated with a capacity for intense destabilization in those with severe complex trauma.

 MDMA broadens the window of tolerance, such that some degree of panic, resistance, or dissociation is not a barrier to effective unlearning of maladaptive patterns during the session. Higher degrees of panic, resistance, or dissociation may still pose difficulty~\cite{razviPresentation}.

MDMA has a few serious medical and drug contraindications, and additional caution and support are warranted in clients with a history dangerous or difficult-to-manage symptoms. It is generally safe and non-addictive in therapeutic contexts. See \cref{sec:safety} for more information.

    \item[Reduced Precision Weighting of Social Priors] MDMA might relax all socially or relationally relevant priors~\cite{carhart2019rebus}. Therapeutically relevant maladaptive priors might largely fall into this category. Lowered precision of priors makes regular sensory information relatively strong enough to update them when attention is brought to those priors.
    \item[Increased Precision Weighting of Sensory Information] MDMA, along with meditation and psychedelics, increases the precision weighting of sensory information. This signal is strong enough to update away any maladaptive priors when those priors are also activated.

    \textit{Supporting Evidence:} External stimuli can be more interesting on MDMA.

    \textit{Contradictory Evidence:} People don't seem to be paying attention to external or bodily stimuli while intensely engaging with maladaptive priors, and, for instance, lying on a couch with an eye mask on.

 Testing them would require fleshing them out more and formalizing them. 


    
    Alternatively, existential safety may be the base state of perception when MDMA turns off some pervasive swath of ever-present prediction error. In either case, the safety is relatively strong enough to update any maladaptive priors with aberrantly high-precision weighting when attention is brought to those priors.

 It seems like one has to be both a specialist in the field and have expertise in causal statistical methods to even evaluate study quality and significance.


    
    the data from one trial participant was not excluded from their data set. The second was that It was retracted for a few reasons~\cite{feduccia2024retraction,nytimesRetraction}. A study therapist sexually abused one trial participant. The researchers knew about this but failed to report it and remove that participant's data from the analysis. They also failed to disclose conflicts of interest. These are major ethical breaches. We still cite the paper because it's the only source of rigorous data on this important phenomenon that we are aware of. Additionally, the effect size was so large that one changed data point wouldn't have significantly changed the outcome. We also don't see an obvious financial conflict regarding the interaction of SSRIs and MDMA.

\textcite{carhart2019rebus} speculates that afterglow is an enduring but temporary relaxation of high-level schemas.



We could not find any high-quality evidence of MDMA-induced post-session neuroplasticity\footnote{Two weeks is the length of time of a certain type of increased neuroplasticity that \textcite{nardouMDMAPlasticity} found following MDMA dosing in mice. However, that lab's results with psilocybin failed to replicate in a large multi-site replication effort, calling their MDMA results into question too~\cite{Lu2025noplasticity}.}, 

 The following assumes that MDMA therapy works as we believe it does and that it isn't just a particularly effective placebo that may stop working when people's expectations for it subside.

     \item \textbf{Misuse:}
        We are not aware of any clear evidence indicating that recreational or solo-therapeutic use of MDMA is problematic as long as the safety considerations in this section are followed. One panel of drug-misuse experts estimated that MDMA poses a significantly lower overall health risk than marijuana and far less than alcohol~\cite{nuttDrugHarms}. While those drugs can be used in harmful ways, they can also be used responsibly with negligible negative effects. In recreational contexts it's still important to avoid mixing drugs (including alcohol), and additional precautions may need to be taken to offset sweating with more water consumption, but not so much as to get hyponatremia.

That's even in recreational contexts where users likely aren't as careful as they could be. Additionally, m

The application of that integrated framework to a practical guide and MDMA therapy is also largely novel. 

Note that in this book we strictly define dissociation as the production and effects of endogenous (self-produced) opioids, despite others having used the term'
We avoid the term dissociation in this book because it is too broad in our opinion, encompassing several phenomena including immobility and strong, unconscious avoidance~\cite{kozlowskaDefenseCascade}. 

Our impression is that, aside from tonic/collapsed immobility, there is a lot of uncertainty about which dissociative, feeling-of-disconnection, and other mental health issues are caused by endogenous opioids vs. unconscious avoidance (see \cref{attention}). The field usually lumps all these together under the umbrella term \textit{dissociation.}

%     % \item (\textit{S})-MDMA. The S enantiomer of MDMA has similar pharmacodynamics to (\textit{R,S})-MDMA, whereas (\textit{R})-MDMA does not~\cite{baggottNewEntactogens}. Using (\textit{S})-MDMA rather than (\textit{R,S})-MDMA may allow lower doses, conceivably reducing risk~\cite{straumann2024racemic}.

We think most techniques for addressing either avoidance or uncertainty boil down to tuning in to whatever, possibly subtle, fear, anger, sadness, or other distress you are feeling in the present moment. 

This manual has three audiences: individuals interested in MDMA therapy for themselves, mental health professionals, and MDMA therapy researchers. Unfortunately, it's difficult to write for all audiences in the same book. We primarily wrote to the therapy client or solo user because that is the foundation of our personal expertise. Consequently, the mental health professional will have to combine the information in this book with their existing training and possibly also with training programs for MDMA-assisted therapy. The necessity of training is likely different for different circumstances. Giving MDMA to a highly functional, securely attached, and emotionally intelligent client to use at home is quite different from an in-person, all-day session with someone with severely disorganized attachment and poor self-awareness.

\footnote{We haven't found any indication that immobility/dissociation is helping people by protecting them from things they couldn't bear, as is commonly claimed by therapists. On the contrary, we suspect that, similarly to avoidance, it inhibits reconsolidation. \textcite{kozlowskaDefenseCascade} presents it as only helpful when it causes a predator (possibly a human) to lose interest in killing you.}

Freezing's function is to put a flight-or-fight response temporarily on hold in situations where the predator may not spot you if you stay very still~\cite{kozlowskaDefenseCascade}. It involves an opioid response, prediction of threat, and possibly some other prediction or mechanism that we are not aware of that differentiates its activators from the activators of flight-or-fight and immobility. In the absence of knowing this other factor, we suggest the same interventions listed for immobility.

These signals might not reconsolidate the originating schema, but they might balance out the amount of threat and powerlessness that the nervous system perceives or possibly deactivate the originating schemas. 

Some clinical experience indicates that MDMA can reconsolidate the originating predictions if immobility isn't so strong that you fall asleep~\cite{razviPSIP}.

\subsection*{Immobility}
As described in \cref{sec:defensecascade}, immobility's (playing dead) function is reducing movement to such an extent that the predator who caught you loses interest and leaves you alone~\cite{kozlowskaDefenseCascade}. While immobility is biologically complex, its effects in large part derive from the brain producing opioids in response to a combination of powerlessness and threat. Of course, the prediction of threat and powerlessness during a therapy session is typically a maladaptive schema instead of an actual threat of imminent death and powerlessness. Therefore, we propose that reducing immobility requires at least one of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reconsolidating the predictions of powerlessness and threat. We think some clinical experience indicates that MDMA can reconsolidate the originating predictions if immobility isn't so strong that you fall asleep~\cite{razviPSIP}. Higher doses, creating a higher sense of safety, may help with higher amounts of immobility~\cite{regan2021Connection}. \textcite{razviPSIP} reports consistent success reconsolidating (our interpretation) the activating schemas for immobility by \enquote{\dots bringing blankness, flat affect, nothingness, boredom, sleepiness, or sobriety [the subjective effects of immobility] into focus.} Further, \enquote{In a psychedelic-assisted session, it might take staying with it from minutes to a full day-long session, but it will crack.} They facilitate this process through a technique they call selective inhibition, which involves the client suppressing all minor body movement and distracting thoughts.
	\item Sending signals of safety or power to your nervous system. The signals might not reconsolidate the originating schema, but they might balance out the amount of threat and powerlessness that the nervous system perceives or possibly deactivate the originating schemas. Additional sources of safety may include an attuned, skilled, and ethical therapist or guide whom you work well with; a comforting and safe physical environment; and sufficient pre-session preparation. We suspect grounding exercises can also do this~\cite{fisherGrounding}. Grounding exercises include exercises like naming 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste. If these techniques lower the amount of immobility you have, they may make reconsolidating the underlying schemas. We don't know whether these techniques are more effective than the previously listed technique in this list.
	% \item There is low-quality evidence that 50--250\,mg of the opioid antagonist naltrexone deactivates opioid-mediated states (like immobility and freezing)~\cite{escamilla2023treatment}. Naloxone and nalmefene have similar mechanisms of action and could conceivably also work, though this hasn't been demonstrated. Naloxone's half-life seems more appropriate to MDMA therapy than naltrexone's. Some of these drugs require prescriptions in certain jurisdictions, and collaboration with a prescribing medical professional may be necessary. We are not aware of any attempts at combining opioid antagonists with MDMA. If you try this novel combination, we suggest using lower doses, as all drugs have side effects, ranges of safe dosing, and interactions with other drugs, including potentially MDMA. \textcite{naltrexoneInfo} provides thorough information about naltrexone. We are unable to provide instructions on safe and effective use here. Reducing immobility may make reconsolidating the schemas triggering it easier.
\end{itemize}



The original situation that created immobility-activating schemas likely also involved extreme levels of fear, anger, and flight-or-fight responses

However, we avoid that term in this book because it is too broad, in our opinion, encompassing many different phenomena~\cite{kozlowskaDefenseCascade,escamilla2023treatment}. Some dissociative disorders may not involve immobility or opioids. Unfortunately, we have been unable to find any convincing mechanistic explanations or categorizations for other possible forms of dissociation and are thus unable to include them in this book. We do discuss avoidance (broadly defined) in \cref{attention}, which some might classify as dissociation when it is automatic and unnoticed. We suggest that anyone experiencing another type of dissociation follow this book's suggestions for immobility and avoidance. They will likely be helpful despite being less targeted because the various types of dissociation all similarly inhibit information processing, which includes reconsolidation.

People in immobility aren't always completely immobile, suggesting immobility is variable, can be overridden by executive control to some degree, or that people develop tolerance to some of the effects. 

\footnote{It appears that immobility evolved to 
        
    While immobility may blunt or temporarily \enquote{protect} you from emotional distress, we haven't found any evidence suggesting that that is immobility's evolutionary primary function. On the contrary, it inhibits information processing (like memory reconsolidation~\cite{eckerUnlocking}), prolonging overwhelming feelings~\cite{laniusNeurobiology}. Immobility's \enquote{protection} may be an accidental byproduct of }

\footnote{Chronic immobility is often framed as adaptive in situations of long-term}

The defense cascade model may have gaps or occasional, atypical interactions with MDMA. 

 These will often be felt after the immobility is reduced~\cite{razviPSIP}. We recommend reviewing the list of immobility symptoms in \cref{sec:signsofdc} before your session. This may help you better identify immobility before it occurs. We recommend \prosecite{razviDissociation} for more information on the topic.

\textcite{razviPSIP} reports better clinical success using a specific kind of cannabis-assisted psychotherapy they developed called psychosomatic somatic interactional psychotherapy (PSIP). 


    \item Triggering yourself harder might make the schema more noticeable, though it might also reactively increase avoidance if the avoidance is trying to protect you from that feeling. See the list of ways to activate maladaptive schemas in \cref{session}.

\textcite{razviPSIP} proposes a technique called \textit{selective inhibition} for \enquote{unsticking} immobility during MDMA therapy, but we suspect it may also be useful for reducing avoidance. 

    One individual with preexisting bipolar II claimed that MDMA triggered a manic episode. Another individual claimed MDMA consistently triggered manic episodes; it's unclear when their bipolar disorder started and they were using higher doses of MDMA than is used in therapy. The third individual had preexisting bipolar I and reported that MDMA consistently activated manic episodes and also deactivated manic episodes when taken during one. Only two reports is notably different from MDMA-induced psychosis, where many case reports are easily found.

While commonly regarded as risky, actual risk in therapeutic contexts is unclear. 

 Bipolar I frequently also involves psychosis, which does have a link to MDMA use.

MDMA is a strong stimulant that generally increases feelings of energy~\cite{vizeliActuteEffects}. Activating schemas (one you are perhaps not aware of) of powerlessness and threat during therapy commonly activates immobility, which can include sleepiness~\cite{kozlowskaDefenseCascade}. We suggest immobility is the most likely cause for sleepiness during a session, though atypical responses to the drug or other medical conditions could conceivably play a role. See \cref{sec:sessionbarriers} for suggestions on working with immobility. We recommend following the immobility guidelines first even if you suspect an atypical stimulant/neurotransmitter response because these conditions may be difficult to distinguish, especially in multiple altered states of consciousness (both MDMA and immobility). \cref{sec:signsofdc} is a list of immobility symptoms that may prove helpful in differentiating immobility from another response.

\subsection{Numbness, Heaviness, or Sleepiness}
This is likely tonic/collapsed immobility. See \cref{sec:signsofdc} for a list of other symptoms and \cref{sec:sessionbarriers} for recommendations on addressing it.

It's conceivable that some people may also have atypical reactions to MDMA, though we suggest working through the above mentioned section first even if you suspect this. Some relatively mentally healthy people report feelings of heaviness on MDMA~\cite{liechtiGender}. 

A higher dose on the next session could provide enough additional safety to engage with these emotions~\cite{regan2021Connection}. Keep in mind that the effects of MDMA increase faster than linearly with dose, so smaller than expected increments should be used~\cite{de2000nonlinear}. See \cref{sec:dosing} for more information. Alternatively, a trusted sitter, guide, or therapist could help provide an additional feeling of safety.

Reconsolidation requires the strength of the mismatch and the maladaptive schema to be somewhat matched~\cite{eckerUnlocking}\footnote{\textcite{eckerUnlocking} reports that this strength mismatch is never an issue in regular psychotherapy. Anecdotal reports suggest that this phenomenon does exist for MDMA therapy. Both too high and too low doses of MDMA impair the therapeutic process.}. The MDMA dose may have been too strong for the schema you wanted to work on. Alternatively, you could try activating a more strongly distressing schema or triggering yourself even harder for the schema you are currently working on.

Additionally, although we do not know how well it fosters unitive and non-dual insight, the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy model is a system for fostering mindful and values-based action~\cite{actSimple}. As such, it may provide a helpful secular framework for exploring some of these concepts, depending on the goals for such exploration.

 in your sense of self, existence, reality, spirituality, or the causes of suffering~\cite{ingramMDMA,ingram2018mastering}.

Unfortunately, it's difficult to describe what these shifts are and what differentiates them from normal therapeutic insights. If you feel confused about this, we suggest reading some material from the second of the lists below and seeing if any of it resonates with your experience.

Other people may inadvertently find themselves on that path through rare experiences with MDMA therapy, psychedelics, other life experiences, or a meditation practice they were using for other purposes.

 It's much more likely that new symptoms are maladaptive schemas or somatic symptoms. See \cref{sectionManagement,psychogenic}.

 Dissociation and avoidance are some of the the largest challenges for MDMA therapy, as they are for traditional psychotherapy~\cite{razviPSIP}. 

    \item Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. We think that one thing, a limited course of MDMA therapy, can durably resolve most symptoms of most mental illnesses, excluding disorders with clear biological or medical causes, for most people. To be fair, it's never actually been established that most mental illnesses don't have a common core. The DSM and ICD--CDDR don't theorize or assess etiology. We're not contradicting any established evidence, just some traditional views.

    \item How does a schema's emotional component fit into the predictive processing framework?

    \item How does a schema map to priors, possibly in multiple pathways like sensory modeling and reward?

We categorize the techniques for reducing avoidance into three buckets: (a) reducing the need for avoidance by increasing feelings of safety, (b) paying attention to schemas in the face of avoidance and feeling unsafe, and (c) reconsolidating a maladaptive schemas that produce the avoidance.

Therefore, we propose the following. First, directly reconsolidating the schemas predicting powerlessness and imminent threat with MDMA therapy may work if the dissociation isn't too strong~\cite{razviPSIP} or if you have learned how to pay attention to maladaptive schemas in the face of distress. Second, deactivating the immiment threat and powerlessness predictions via indications of safety, power, or distraction. This might allow you to gently refocus on those schemas and reconsolidate them before they become so strong that they produce unworkable dissociation.

Increasing feelings of safety during the session allows you to pay better attention to, and reconsolidate maladaptive schemas. It can also reduce avoidance and dissociation.

Avoidance is often itself a maladaptive schema (e.g., \enquote{I'll die if I feel that.}) rather than simple avoidance of (intense) discomfort or uncertainty about what to do. If this is the case, reconsolidating this schema first will be more useful than trying to bypass it. If you don't reconsolidate it, it may keep coming back to impede the therapeutic process. We suggest:

    Selective inhibition involves suppressing voluntary distractions, like minor movements and escapist thoughts~\cite{razviPSIP}. We hypothesize this may reduce the \enquote{noise} in your mind, making the active maladaptive schema more noticeable. You then pay attention to that distressing emotion or physical sensations of distress (muscle tension, altered breathing patterns, etc.), and the associated schema reconsolidates.

    While they designed this technique for dissociation, we think it's highly promising for avoidance as well.

    \textcite{razviPSIP} reports consistent success reconsolidating (our interpretation) the activating schemas for dissociation by \enquote{\dots bringing blankness, flat affect, nothingness, boredom, sleepiness, or sobriety [the subjective effects of dissociation] into focus.} \enquote{In a psychedelic-assisted session, it might take staying with it from minutes to a full day-long session, but it will crack.}

\footnote{They don't frame it in terms of reconsolidation and schemas, but the technique involves focusing attention on subtle sensations of distress during intense dissociation, while supressing distractions.}

%There is no solid data on how long this takes, so anyone's guess is just a guess. Our first guess is that the 6\,week spacing used in the phase III trials is reasonable since, as far as we are aware, it didn't cause any neurological or cognitive issues obvious enough to be reported. While moderate oxidative stress may not cause obvious issues after three sessions, we don't know of any better line of reasoning.

 \section{Psychoeducation}
\label{sec:psychoeducation}
In the course of researching this book, we've come across a number of interesting or helpful educational resources that may be relevant to the needs of therapeutic MDMA practitioners. Many have been individually helpful to us or come recommended by trusted colleagues. Although we have not rigorously evaluated all these items, we chose to include them on the assumption that our readership may find value in such a list. Note that most of these resources are not theoretically rigorous in the sense of framing things in terms of schemas and predictive processing.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \prosecite{eckerUnlocking} may have popularized the connection between prediction error, memory reconsolidation, and therapeutic improvement. We think it is required reading for all mental health professionals. \textcite{ecker2015misunderstood} provides a complementary resource addressing common misunderstandings and clarifies some fundamental mechanisms.
    \writtenByDay{
    \item \prosecite{kennedy2022good} illustrates calmly and thoroughly what it looks like when several of the healthiest and most \enquote{workable} schemas play out in a parenting realm and compares them to common, less workable alternatives. The author has elsewhere described this school of thought as \enquote{study parenting}: introducing parents to schemas and behavioral strategies that allow them to be sturdy leaders in a family setting. Many of the strategies focus on differentiating between parents' emotional support of children and parents' behavioral compliance with children's demands. Kennedy encourages parents to provide a basically unlimited amount of validation and witnessing of their children's struggles and to develop robust emotional relationships in which they earn the trust to witness their children's inner worlds. At the same time, she clearly illustrates that this emotional intimacy can be paired with robust boundaries around children's behavior. Both those boundaries and that validation are essential for cultivating children's experience of safety in the world and trust in themselves.

    We find this book to be an excellent resource for parents and non-parents alike. It's true that the triggers of dysregulation will be different for non-parents than for the parents and young children who the book directly addresses. However, the basic behavioral patterns the book promotes are tremendously adaptive and are adaptable to any kind of relationship. Additionally, we suspect that working with this book may facilitate attachment healing through schema reconsolidation in the same vein as Ideal Parent Figure imagery.
    \item \prosecite{mcgonigalStress} discusses how not all stress is harmful. Short-lived stress can foster resilience and growth. The book highlights the importance of mindset and provides tools to reinterpret stressors as growth opportunities.
    \item \prosecite{pryorDog} helps you think about and change the incentives causing unwanted behaviors.
    }
    \item If you're interested in the general theory of predictions in the brain, we highly recommend \prosecite{eckerUnlocking} as essential reading for all mental health professionals and anyone else interested in schemas in a therapeutic context. Scott Alexander's review~\cite{alexanderSurfing} of \prosecite{clark2015surfing}, is also an excellent introduction to the general theory of predictions in the brain. \prosecite{clark2024experience} is a more mass-market version.
    \item \prosecite{gottmanTrust}, describes using emotional attunement to build healthy relationships.
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Self-Education:} See \cref{sec:psychoeducation} and the rest of this book.

\enquote{Nonviolent Communication is the integration of four things: Consciousness: a set of principles that support living a life of compassion, collaboration, courage, and authenticity.

Means of influence: sharing \enquote{power with others} rather than using \enquote{power over others}}
Effective conflict resolution is valuable for any relationship. 

Many MDMA therapy clients have unanswered questions, feel distressed, or are confused about parts of their professionally guided MDMA therapy sessions. Additionally, many therapists lack critical information about MDMA therapy. This section isn't a full accounting of all the things one needs to know to be an MDMA therapist. Rather, it's a c

The providers in \textcite{bender2025provider} recommended an average of 10 combined hours of pre- and post-session psychological support for individuals with serious mental illness undergoing psychedelic therapy for the first time.

	\item \prosecite{miller2014secrets} explores the concept of \textit{supershrinks,} therapists who consistently achieve superior outcomes regardless of their theoretical orientation or specific techniques. The authors argue that exceptional performance in therapy, as in other fields, is primarily the result of deliberate practice and ongoing feedback rather than innate talent or experience alone. They propose a three-part formula for improving therapeutic effectiveness: determining one's baseline of effectiveness, engaging in deliberate practice, and consistently seeking and incorporating client feedback. By tracking outcomes, comparing performance to national norms, and actively working to improve skills through targeted practice and reflection, the authors suggest that all therapists can significantly enhance their effectiveness and client outcomes.

One panel of drug-misuse experts ranked MDMA at 2\% the risk of alcohol for harm to others~\cite{nuttDrugHarms}. 

We can't responsibly suggest how to interpret or use this data, given its uncertain origin. We would personally use somewhere between 1--2\times\ the upper limit, so 2--4\,weeks.



The reductions can be done by reducing both the initial and booster doses by 10\%, or by eliminating the booster dose and increasing the initial dose such that the total dose is reduced by 10\%. 

The structure of our societies and culture often makes forming healthy relationships difficult. We suggest making relationships a higher priority in your life through, for instance, co-living, co-working, volunteering, or seeking romantic, artistic, or business partnerships. \prosecite{brownDaring} is a good resource.


   \item Healthy relationships improve mental and physical health~\cite{holt-lunstadRelationships}.


   \item Consider how you cope with stress. Which behaviors are healthy for you and those around you? Which aren't?

      \item There is low-quality evidence that journaling improves mental health~\cite{sohalJournaling}.

 Its efficacy for sleep disorders without comorbid mental illness is well-established, but it is poorly studied for sleep disorders caused by mental illness. 

 If you try this novel combination, we suggest using lower doses, as all drugs have side effects, ranges of safe dosing, and interactions with other drugs, including potentially MDMA. \textcite{naltrexoneInfo} provides thorough information about naltrexone. We are unable to provide instructions on safe and effective use here.

 Session frequency, another important piece of safety, is addressed separately in \cref{frequency}.

 One-third of that total dose came from a booster dose 50\% the strength of the initial dose taken 1.5--2.5\,hours later to extend the productive duration of the session. 

  This was used as the basis for the large phase III trials that used three 120\,+\,60\,mg sessions~\cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial}.

   We varyingly report fixed doses vs. mg/kg because the .

We have also not seen any evidence suggesting that MDMA-induced oxidative stress is practically significant. 

Beyond these somewhat established states, the defense cascade model may have gaps or occasional, atypical interactions with MDMA. \textcite{razviPSIP} reports another state sometimes encountered during MDMA therapy where a person \enquote{may have very little or no response to substances as powerful as MDMA or psilocybin. They will feel sober, or bored or sleepy as if they could get up and go about their day. If a therapist wasn't in the room, they might fall asleep during the height of an MDMA session.} Sleepiness, soberness, and boredom are neither effects of immobility nor MDMA. This suggests there might be at least one more poorly understood state or interaction between a state and MDMA.

% When recovering from trauma, it is common for your moral framework to become intertwined with maladaptive schemas-leading to unhealthy ethical frameworks like the \enquote{I must save the world to be a valid person} belief discussed in \prosecite{mate2011body}. At the same time, cultures and institutions often dismiss major harms-current examples relevant to mainstream US culture include childbirth trauma and the trauma of living through a mass extinction; past examples include enslavement or \enquote{resettlement schools.} In situations like these, we posit that traumatized survivors represent an important repository of experience, essential for crafting cultural shifts that could help avoid the future repetition of these and similar harms. As such, it is important not to dismiss the moral intuition generated by traumatic experience, but rather to approach it with compassionate curiosity, as one important source of insight among many.

, and what moral axioms are true, if moral axioms can even \textit{be} true

 and solving it in a way that's convincing to other philosophers would simultaneously make you one of the most influential philosophers in history and resolve one of the most fundamental mysteries of existence

 The second is dependent on a few critical open problem in moral philosophy and solving them would be similarly monumental~\cite{metaEthics}.

 Obviously, the answers to some questions depends on knowing things about these beings' lives. We suggest looking for information from a variety of disagreeing but high-quality sources.

This type of activity may bring up a lot of maladaptive schemas related to self-worth, identity, safety, and belonging. There isn't a well-defined boundary between mental-illness schemas and the sort of schemas that you might find in this activity.

% We posit that taking a holistic approach to compassion and cognitive empathy can avoid major oversights in our personal actions and beliefs, allowing us to maximize the benefits of a more connected and compassionate life by exercising compassion in areas where we otherwise might not have. Additionally, we posit that formalizing your compassionate impulses can sometimes lead to better prioritization and better outcomes.\footnote{Formal ethical systems, like the various forms of deontology, virtue ethics, and consequentialism, are just the result of taking people's existing moral intuitions, writing them out in precise language, and resolving any conflicts.} Both of these practices may assist us in expanding our moral intuition into new situations.

Of course, it may be that your issues actually aren't schema-based, in which case a different approach is needed.

, in no small part because of the limitations of current mental health practice and science

 We think the clearest limitations are drug dependence, psychosis, and mania. However, even those issues also often involve a psychological component that could be addressed.

These add up to our beliefs being less constrained by the common pressures of the mental health field.

 that often goes beyond healthy humility to function as a collective, field-wide tactic for maintaining psychiatry's status despite the field having no explanation or cure for the vast majority of mental illnesses~\cite{whooleyIgnorance}.

It's not even clear to what degree these uncertainties are conceptually resolvable; they could be computationally intractable even with perfect information, which itself is impossible to acquire. 



For instance, one query was \enquote{Is there any unambiguous evidence that any mental illness is caused by biological abnormalities rather than biological abnormalities being symptoms of sympathetic or parasympathetic activation from maladaptive schemas/predictions, or lifestyle changes caused by maladaptive schemas?} 

Basically none of the psychology articles we cite have established causation beyond all reasonable doubt. We also don't generally cite effect sizes.

High-control communities and abusers may be unhappy about increases in independence. Likewise, communities that form an identity around their fear, hatred, or subjugation of an out-group may be unhappy about increased compassion for the out-group. 

, like it can weaken the reinforcing elements of any schema-based maladaptive state

Certain beliefs and behaviors surrounding the therapeutic process itself are helpful for avoiding local minima. 


	\item Continually reconsolidating whatever maladaptive schema is most active in the moment during the session, as MDMA seems to do in our experience, will eventually shift the dominant mental state from maladaptive to adaptive. Skillfully choosing which schemas to reconsolidate at different points is unnecessary, though it might be helpful. Certainty --- medium. The phase III trials reported excellent long-term results using non-directive therapy~\cite{mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial2,mitchellMDMAClinicalTrial,mithoeferManual}, which we interpret as the clients reconsolidating whatever maladaptive schemas and issues are most important to them . This doesn't indicate that this approach always works and never gets stuck in any local minima (see the last part of \cref{sec:complex}).

\textcite{carhart2019rebus} hypothesizes that MDMA relaxes all socially/relationally relevant schemas, which are typically the kind of schemas that trauma causes. Once those schemas are relaxed, all types of contradictory information have higher relative strength and are more liable to induce prediction error and reconsolidation. 

    \item M.G. is exceptionally invested in getting everything correct and actionable because their survival might depend on it. This is also a source of potential bias.

    \item The recommended oxidative-stress minimum session spacing happened to exactly match M.G.'s preexisting personal minimum session spacing.

 This includes overattachment to the \enquote{no one knows the causes} position commonly held by psychiatrists and researchers.

  These are commonly pharmaceutical company payments, grant review committees demanding that researchers pretend the DSM/ICD categories are real or useful, hiring committees selecting for ideological positions, insurance payments tied to DSM/ICD diagnoses, colleagues' opinions, and public status.

    \item M.G.'s mechanistic, natural sciences background oriented the project to memory reconsolidation, complex systems, and the defense cascade.

 There are certainly instances of temporary functional decreases and symptom worsening due to MDMA therapy-induced disruption of schema networks that were adaptive at some point in the past but are no longer adaptive. See our discussion in \cref{sec:complex}. 

 This assumes the interviewer is not invested in a biological reductionist view.\footnote{No unambiguous biological causal factor has ever been found that explains a major part of any common mental illness, excluding rare things like neurosyphilis, thyroid disorders, etc.}

 Arousal is in anxiety disorders. Flight-or-fight is in classic PTSD. Immobility is in dissociative PTSD, possibly other dissociative disorders, and possibly depression.\footnote{If you run a clustering analysis on mental health symptoms, PTSD, generalized anxiety, and depression actually get grouped together as possibly a single phenomenon~\cite{kotov2017hierarchical}.}

    \item M.G. (semi-maladaptively) feels that improving access to effective and safe reconsolidation is important for their personal safety.

    \item The proposal that each case of mental illness is a unique complex system of schemas may be difficult to prove with \enquote{objective} measurements for the foreseeable future. The model is built on reports from clients and therapists.
    
It may have been selected for in a past where survival was much more tenuous than in it today for most people and where societies were much smaller. 



\section{[unedited] Psychological Screening and Building Regulation}
There is expert consensus among therapists specializing in PTSD and complex PTSD (CPTSD) that treatment of CPTSD should be staged~\cite{cloitreStaged}. We suspect CPTSD means most cases of complex trauma, severely non-secure attachment, and moderate-to-severe mental illness, given the strong overlap between diagnostic categories. Staged treatment 

This can lead to a strong upward trajectory, whereas the same amount of reconsolidation spread over a longer period of time might not achieve the same critical mass necessary.

A portion of people experience a temporary period of post-session symptom exacerbation. Only do MDMA therapy if you are willing to go through this. It is a part of the healing process; it is usually mild-to-moderate and short-lasting, but can be severe in rare circumstances.
    
    Prepare robust psychological support to manage potential post-session destabilization if you have severe complex trauma, diagnosed mental illness, or severely non-secure attachment.

    
 These coping tools may, in some cases, actually resolve your issue. However, without reconsolidation, some issues are more likely to remain latent and reactivate in certain circumstances.

 By bringing attention to the body, it could conceivably facilitate processes like reconsolidating schemas relating to the body or increasing your understanding of how schemas, defense cascade activation, and your body interact with each other.

\item \textbf{Fatigue or Exhaustion:} Intense therapeutic experiences often destabilize an entrenched pattern of schemas. We suspect that this can initiate a period of \enquote{natural} reconsolidation that occurs without a deliberate reconsolidation practice. This can produce a therapy hangover if it is intense enough.    

\textcite{ecstaticIntegration} contains a wealth of information on adverse effects.

Consider asking for food, water, tea, someone to sit with you, or someone to watch a movie with you.

\textcite{robinson2024coming} surveyed people who have experienced prolonged post-psychedelic difficulties about what coping strategies and support helped them. This study did not focus only on MDMA or therapeutic use, so these results may only partially apply here. The most common techniques people reported being helpful, in decreasing order of commonality, were peers and community support, meditation and prayer, professional therapeutic or coaching assistance, self-educational reading about the issue, physical exercise, breathing techniques, journaling, acceptance and surrender, embodied contemplative practices, and time in nature. When receiving emotional support, participants most commonly reported the following as helpful: talking and feeling heard, acceptance and validation, and shared similar experiences.

\textcite{argyri2025practitioner} surveyed psychedelic therapy professionals about their beliefs on what helps people with post-psychedelic difficulties. This study did not focus only on MDMA or therapeutic use, so these results may only partially apply here. They reported, in order from most cited to least cited: individual psychotherapy (particularly trauma-informed approaches), grounding and mindfulness techniques, peer and community support, meaning-making and narrative reconstruction, and in some cases, short-term psychiatric drugs.

Here are what we think are good examples of the previously mentioned practices and some additional practices we think are relevant. Note that unless otherwise specified, most of these probably haven't been rigorously studied. However, they are generally low risk, common practice, or common sense.

Many symptoms are just temporary physiological side effects of MDMA, which can last up to 3\,days~\cite{liechtiGender}. See \cref{table:sideeffects} for a list. 

    We used the Claude AI model's research function, which reads and synthesizes hundreds of web resources (particularly scientific papers), to look for evidence that contradicts our model. We didn't treat any research report as definitive and have observed that it is often incorrect. Rather, we treat it as one source of evidence among many and always double check its reasoning by reading the primary sources. 

\footnote{High-quality studies tend to have preregisteration, active placebo control, unblinding and expectancy effects measured and adjusted for, independent data analysis, unbiased staff, open data and code, multi-site design, etc.}

There is low-quality evidence that breathing exercises reduce stress~\cite{fincham2023breathwork}.

    \item Visualize a safe space where you feel like your truest self. Imagine vivid sensations, like the feel of your bare feet on a forest floor if that's comforting to you, to increase its power.

    \item Why does MDMA therapy facilitate prediction error for some schemas but not others? Why are the schemas it tends to reconsolidate casually or therapeutically identifiable as \textit{maladaptive.} This may depend on what \textit{maladaptive} means. A process can only be adaptive or maladaptive in relation to a goal or optimization function. Predictive processing posits that the brain's fundamental optimization function is minimizing prediction error, but it remains to be seen which particular sources of prediction error that function contains in most people~\cite{clark2015surfing}. Some near-immutable intrinsic sources of prediction error for almost everyone may include hunger, thirst, pain, and the need for companionship.

Using specific sources of prediction error, as is often done in regular therapy, may be more useful for targeting a single schema.

    \item Mapping your triggers can help you avoid or manage overwhelming situations. Safety mapping is a valuable tool for identifying sources of safety and threat in your life. Journal about the things, places, practices, people, or situations with which you feel safe and at home, and with which you feel unsafe. Then make a diagram with two axes, safe-feeling and accessibility. Plot at least the top 10 items you journaled about on this diagram. You can use this information to imagine a safe, comforting scenario when you feel overwhelmed. Imagine vivid sensations, like the feel of your bare feet on a forest floor if that's comforting to you, to increase its power. You can also set boundaries around stimuli that activate challenging schemas. For example, you could tell someone you feel overwhelmed when they discuss a particular topic, and you would appreciate them avoiding it.
    }

    \item Exercises like noticing five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one that you can taste.

\textcite{argyri2025practitioner} also recommended looking for five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.

\section{[unedited] Distraction Tools}
Coping tools are anything that temporarily deactivates (grounding exercises) your maladaptive schemas or distracts you from your current state of distress. They are highly individual because an activity that calms one person may do the opposite for someone else. \textcite{argyri2025practitioner} reported consensus among psychedelic therapy practitioners on the benefit of coping tools (called grounding practices in the paper). However, few individuals experiencing prolonged post-psychedelic difficulties think they are helpful~\cite{robinson2024coming}. The only  We recommend using them only as much as necessary, since, as a form of avoidance, they may delay healing.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tensing and relaxing muscle groups one by one. See \textcite{michiganProgressive}.
    \item Weighted blankets, holding a comforting object, or touch from a trusted person.
    \item Warm baths, creating novels, TV, videos, creating art, nature walks, pleasant scents, hot herbal tea, reading, interacting with pets.
    \item Imagining a safe container or box where difficult memories can be stored until you have time for reconsolidation.
    \item Deep breathing exercises.
    \item Setting boundaries with people around certain topics that activate your maladaptive schemas.
\end{itemize}

Randomized controlled trials show no long-term mental health benefit of learning emotional regulation\footnote{We assume emotional regulation is roughly the same as grounding.} skills in addition to reconsolidation~\cite{selePhased,oprelPhased,vlietPhased}.


        
    A state of consciousness akin to a low-intensity version of the MDMA state of consciousness can sometimes be reactivated using cues that were present during the MDMA session. The cues we know of include playing music and visualizing yourself in the location of a particularly magical MDMA session. It's not clear to us how such a capacity emerges or works, and we haven't found any papers describing the phenomenon. There are two original reports of it in \cref{internalizedReports}, and predictive processing hypotheses for how it works in \cref{ppHypotheses}.

 and \prosecite{walkingMeditation}

 The basic process of walking meditation can also be applied to many other daily tasks. Body movement practices that focus attention on your body, like yoga or stretching, might help too if you avoid feeling your body.

 Gains in functionality and emotional health often depend on reconsolidation of the underlying maladaptive schemas~\cite{eckerUnlocking}. We guesstimate that accessing the maximum possible benefits from reconsolidation may take anywhere from single-digit hours of mismatching for the simplest problems to single-digit thousands of hours for the most severe mental illness. These estimates do not include the overhead of uncovering schemas, finding mismatches, finding techniques that work for you, or developing relationships with therapists. Because there are risks from extremely high cumulative MDMA use~\cite{tagen2023valvular,corayMemory}, and because MDMA sessions have significant logistical or financial costs, we recommend using the techniques listed in this section to achieve the bulk of your therapeutic progress.

People sometimes report that between-session reconsolidation exercises are easier for some period of time following an MDMA session (see \cref{afterglow}). If this occurs for you, and if you want to accelerate healing, we recommend spending more effort on and experimenting with reconsolidation exercises in this period. You may even find that maxing out your reconsolidation capacity every day will deliver large amounts of therapeutic progress. Developing the skill of sober reconsolidation can reduce your therapeutic reliance on MDMA and allow reconsolidation in a wide variety of circumstances where MDMA use is not appropriate. When well-developed, it also allows faster healing because the safety and logistical considerations of MDMA therapy are no longer limiting.

for additional healing between or instead of MDMA sessions. Those doing solo healing may find more or less luck attempting these methods on themselves. We suggest, if therapist cost or availability are significant barriers, that at least a few sessions with a trained professional can be greatly beneficial for learning a technique. Many therapists offer video therapy available from anywhere with a good internet connection, though therapists are often legally prohibited from working with clients outside their state or country of licensure.



\textcite{eckerUnlocking} makes the case that many therapeutic frameworks explicitly or implicitly follow these 7 steps, quoted here:

\begin{quotation}
\subsubsection*{Preparation (Accessing sequence)}
\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\Alph{enumi}.}
    \item Identify symptom
    \item Retrieve target learning (symptom-generating schema)
    \item Identify contradictory knowledge
\end{enumerate}

[Anecdotal reports indicate that B \& C are often not necessary. Some people successfully use the present moment to reconsolidate any unknown maladaptive schema. Some of them do this without ever having used MDMA, while others learn to internalize the process of MDMA therapy (see \cref{internalizedReports}).]

\subsubsection*{Transformation (Unlearning sequence)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Reactivate target learning (B)
    \item Co-activate contradictory knowledge (C)
    \item Repeat pairing of (B)+(C)

    \renewcommand{\labelenumi}{V.}

        \item Effortless permanence
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{quotation}


Using non-MDMA prescription psychiatric drugs is outside the scope of this book.

\textcite{supportNetwork} has recommended the following organizations offering support for psychedelic-induced challenging experiences and adverse effects. 

In the following sections we separate grounding tools that connect you to the present moment and deactivate maladaptive schemas, reconsolidation tools, and distraction tools. However, we were sometimes unsure which category a specific tool belonged in, so treat these categorizations as tentative. Additinoally, a certain tool may facilitate grounding for one person and distraction for another.

    Reconsolidation requires juxtaposing a maladaptive schema with contradictory evidence, and anecdotal reports suggest that the present moment can function as a contradictory experience for many maladaptive schemas. Acknowledging maladaptive schemas and then dismissing them from awareness and refocusing on the present moment might be a coping tool, whereas keeping your attention on both the schema and the present moment may facilitate reconsolidation.

, and its efficacy for sleep disorders without comorbid mental illness is well-established, but it is poorly studied for sleep problems caused by anxiety

\writtenByDay{
It can delay your healing to deny that you're having feelings at all, which is tempting to do when the feelings are very overwhelming. However, it is also important to feel and process your feelings on your timeline; when you are feeling more than you are ready to feel, distraction can be extremely nourishing and helpful. Can you focus on self-care tasks? Is this the moment to organize your art supplies or clean out your closet? Is there some form of work that feels accessible or good to you right now? Or maybe there's a movie or a video game or an Instagram or a comic that can provide a great distraction.

\section{[unedited] [need to cite better] Making Positive Life Changes}
\label{sec:behavioralchange}
Some people may find that as they reconsolidate schemas and have positive disconfirming experiences, they have less need for compulsive self-soothing over time. They benefit from the therapy not just through reconsolidation, but through the support that the subsequent peace and perspective provide for positive behavioral changes. Sometimes being in a rut is the function of inertia; sometimes it is self protective, and improved regulation or a sense of new experience or perspective can help a person break out of it.

\subsection*{How MDMA Impacts Behavioral Change Goal Selection}
We advise refraining from drastic life-shaping decisions immediately post-session. MDMA insights may sharply highlight certain aspects of a situation which you had not been facing or focusing on before the therapy. Although these insights may be extremely important, we feel they can best be understood in the broader context of your life both before and after the MDMA session and the immediate post-session period.

We recommend avoiding major life changes during the immediate post-session period unless (a) you have wanted to make those changes for a significant time prior to your MDMA experience, (b) you are (and have been) very sure and very committed about the change you want to make, and (c) you have access to other forms of support around that change, for instance, regular social connection with individuals who enact the behavior you are interested in adopting, an accountability buddy, etc. (see below for further discussion of structural supports) When these three conditions are met, we are hopeful that MDMA neuroplasticity could provide a helpful layer of support for larger behavioral and lifestyle shifts.

On the other hand, MDMA therapy may more routinely facilitate a \enquote{baby steps} approach where individuals make small changes as they feel capable of making them, with the neuroplasticity window providing an opportune time to build positive habits and process emotional memories.

\subsection*{Barriers to Behavioral Change + Resources to Support Selected Changes}
Most people have some habitual behaviors they have wished to change for a long time. In this section, we will review common reasons people struggle to make behavior changes they want, and offer an overview of strategies for overcoming these barriers. Additionally, we have included a fairly comprehensive appendix (see \cref{sec:lifechanges}) of evidence based recommendations for behavior changes that are likely to have a positive effect for most people who implement them. It includes at least one recommended resource about each of those changes. We hope this appendix will assist readers in identifying the behavioral changes with the lowest cost and the highest reward possible, including changes they may not have previously considered as possibilities. Additionally, we hope the information throughout this section will support our readers in using their neuroplasticity windows as effectively as possible, and that behavioral change efforts in the aftermath of therapeutic MDMA use can amplify the benefits of these interventions.

Many people feel puzzled or frustrated by their inability to enact important behavioral changes that they know would improve their quality of life or which are strongly aligned with their values. These may be things like enacting an exercise routine, ceasing porn use to adhere to religious values, or adopting a vegan diet to minimize climate change. In modern US culture, individuals often judge and blame themselves for \enquote{not having enough willpower} to successfully make these changes. For some, this can be a perpetual source of shame: because of their failure to enact desired behavioral changes, they begin to attribute negative characteristics to their identity, to consider themselves to be apathetic, stupid, lazy, a bad friend/partner/parent/student/employee, or whatever other negative identity might apply to the situation.

However, research shows that the individuals who are most successful at making these kinds of changes are also (a) likely to frame their shortcomings in terms of behavior (creating guilt) rather than framing them in terms of identity (creating shame), and (b) likely to engage a greater level of structural support for their desired behavior change. Finally, most behavioral health goals have a strong emotional regulation component, even beyond the intensity of a shame response.

Structural support can broadly be categorized as \enquote{trigger supports} and \enquote{access supports.} Trigger supports relate to what initiates a particular behavior. \textit{Tiny Habits} by BJ Fogg gives the example of a woman who wanted to get up early and exercise before work, but found herself using the time after her alarm went off in the morning scrolling through her phone instead. After considering several possibilities, she started using an alarm clock and leaving her phone in the kitchen overnight. This removed the trigger for the behavior she was trying to avoid. Other examples of trigger support would include a parent reminding their child to do chores, or someone who wants to spend some time reading every day leaving their book on the couch cushion where they typically sit upon coming home from work. Access supports are things that reduce the level of effort it takes to engage in a desired behavior. A home washer and dryer unit would be an access support for someone with the goal of keeping up with their laundry needs; a private chef, or a week of meal prep in the fridge, would be an access support for someone who is trying to adjust their eating habits. A \enquote{dumb phone} and a social working environment with co-workers who feel safe and are supportive of the goal would be access supports for someone whose goal is not to scroll through the internet while they are at work. Creative and extensive use of structural supports can make all the difference in behavioral change success.

Finally, the emotional regulation component of behavioral change is frequently under-rated. People often attribute their inability to enact a desired change to motivation or willpower problems, and then beat themselves up for these perceived failures. The more constructive approach is to implement applicable trigger supports and access supports, and then, if motivation still seems to be a problem, to engage with motivation enhancing strategies such as setting up a \enquote{fishbowl,} or using the other social accountability strategies.

Procrastination is most centrally an emotional regulation problem; it emerges from feelings of overwhelm, often followed by shame about the procrastination itself. The single most effective strategy to address procrastination, in our clinical experience, is to practice breaking tasks down into manageable parts. If the procrastinated task is getting out of bed and taking a shower while severely depressed, this might look like calling a friend, then talking through and enacting the process of throwing the covers back, putting one foot on the floor, putting the other foot on the floor, walking towards the bathroom, opening the door, and so on. If the task is an hour-long marketing presentation, the first step in ending procrastination might be talking through with a mentor how to break the project down into the smallest parts possible.

Self-destructive behaviors generally are associated with feelings of shame. We recommend \prosecite{brownThought}.

\subsection*{Behavioral Change Goal Selection in the Age of Addiction}
In the words of Anna Lembke~\cite{lembke2021dopamine}:
\begin{quotation}
    We've transformed the world from a place of scarcity into a place of overwhelming abundance: drugs, food, news, gambling, shopping, gaming, texting, sexting, Facebooking, Instagramming, YouTubing, tweeting \dots\ the increased numbers, variety, and potency of highly rewarding stimuli today is staggering. The smartphone is the modern-day hypodermic needle, delivering digital dopamine\footnote{\textit{M.G.'s note:} The dopamine theory of addiction, while popular, is more limited and nuanced than popularly thought~\cite{nutt2015dopamine}.} 24/7 for a wired generation. If you haven't met your drug of choice yet, it's coming soon to a website near you. Scientists rely on dopamine as a kind of universal currency for measuring the addictive potential of any experience. The more dopamine in the brain's reward pathway, the more addictive the experience.
\end{quotation}

Addiction is a complex and overwhelming phenomena, with biological, psychological, social, and structural components. It exists on a spectrum of compulsive behaviors. A person's desire to change their relationship with a given substance or behavior can vary widely: on the one end, someone may want to stop eating fast food on twice-yearly road trips when they already never eat it at any other time. On the other end, someone may have a desperate need to retrieve their life from the encompassing grasp of methamphetamine or heroin. Although it has become socially acceptable to joke or vent about our less destructive addictive tendencies---like a mild coffee or a social media habit---our current societal, economic, and technological structures generally provide poor support for individuals struggling with addictive tendencies at all levels. Individuals use substances and behaviors that have negative consequences because those substances and behaviors solve some kind of problem for the individual who uses them. The most effective way to assist individuals who are struggling with these kinds of harmful coping patterns is typically multipronged. It might include any or all of the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Medication assistance to reduce cravings for a harmful substance
    \item Opportunities to contribute to and connect with their communities in meaningful ways while sober
    \item Peer support
    \item Psychotherapy
    \item Case management: helping the individual access a variety of needed contexts and resources
    \item Contingency management: creating accelerated and enhanced positive and negative consequences supporting the desired behavior changes
    \item Other executive function support, such as tailoring the living environment to support the preferred coping choices and building healthy habits like sleep and meditation, which support impulse control
    \item Intensive medical and psychiatric management of any underlying issues that have induced them to use the harmful coping mechanisms
\end{itemize}

The average individual who struggles with addictive behaviors, far from being able to bombard the problem from all sides as I've described above, is shamed for not being able to simply choose to stop using the harmful coping mechanism. This typically increases use of the harmful behavior or substance. In short, we live in an age where addiction has been aggressively stigmatized/shamed and resources for treating it denied, while resources and structural support for maintaining addiction have been amplified. \textit{Crossover addiction,} where individuals who struggle with one addictive coping practice simply shift their dependence onto another addictive coping practice, is pervasive. Although we would all like to see ourselves as independent decision makers, we increasingly live in an attention economy where massive investment has been made in competing for each nanosecond of our attention. It is increasingly difficult to capture those moments of our own attention back, and to focus them on our safety, flourishing, freedom, and connection with others.

To make matters worse, despite emerging from the \enquote{overwhelming abundance} Anna Lembke describes above, addiction creates scarcity. It creates a scarcity mindset regarding access to the coping mechanism, whether that's time for gaming or money for heroin, and in its worse iterations, it inspires compulsive behaviors that are financially, socially, and medically destructive in the extreme. Just as important for the problem of escaping addiction, it perpetuates scarcity around meaning and human connection. Addictive coping mechanisms numb feelings all around, impeding our ability to be vulnerable and connect deeply with one another and with the things we find important in life. In rats, non-heroin-using individuals were found to help a fellow rat escape from a trap, while heroin using rats didn't bother.

Second, despite the dystopian background, strategic habit development can (with commitment over time) provide access to cornerstone strategies on which to build a better life. To select a behavioral change goal that's right for you, consider your own motivation, your life experience, the degree to which the behavior change offers benefits across a range of life domains. For instance, regular exercise or meditation can help many individuals with pain management, depressive symptoms, and physical health. To find the right foundational habits for you, you'll need to consider your individual supports, accessibility challenges, and barriers. We make some general suggestions that are beneficial for a majority of people in \cref{sec:lifechanges}.

A harm reduction framework is both evidence-based and essential when addressing addictive coping patterns. We once read (maybe in the book \textit{tiny habits}?) that the most important characteristic for personal growth is the ability to experience satisfaction from small victories. Abstinence is an excellent goal for many people in many situations, but abstinence is not interesting or realistic for in many situations. In those cases, your welfare may depend on your ability to give care to yourself by identifying the harms your coping mechanism creates and mitigating those harms in more realistic ways. There are incremental victories to be had that make a significant difference in the level of harm an addictive coping mechanism creates in a person's life. You may reduce the amount you use, or regulate the timing (only after work), or refrain from mixing multiple substances or from gambling in the first three days after your paycheck comes in. If you are not ready to stop drinking, you may focus on making sure that you get all your driving and work accomplished before you start drinking each day, and that you stay hydrated and eat some healthy food on the regular. Maybe you want to start meditating for three minutes each day before you start drinking. These measures are meaningful. They reduce harm, improve your quality of life, and will leave you in better shape if the day comes when you are ready to make bigger changes. It's important to adopt a mental framework (and cultivate a support system) that sees the value of small improvements and supports you in making the changes you are interested in and ready to make.
