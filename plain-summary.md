# Dissociation and Avoidance During the Session

Avoidance and dissociation are difficult to deal with because they
impede reconsolidation, including reconsolidation of the very schemas
that create avoidance and dissociation. This dynamic forms a maladaptive
attractor state. This section focuses on techniques that destabilize
this state of stuckness. We group avoidance and dissociation together
because they both inhibit conscious experiences of contradiction, a
requirement for reconsolidation, they are dealt with similarly, and it
may not always be clear which one is present.

M.G. and Razvi & Elfrink (2020) both report that successful experiences
of engaging with maladaptive schemas (our interpretation) in the
presence of dissociation and avoidance make the process much easier in
subsequent sessions. We think it is a skill primarily learned through
experience. Therefore, this section is mostly focused on facilitating
successful experiences and building this skill.

We define avoidance in this context as deliberately or automatically
(often unnoticed) diverting attention away from maladaptive schemas.
Uncertainty about the process of tuning in to maladaptive schemas might
also play a similar role. As described in
<a href="#sec:defensecascade" data-reference-type="ref+label"
data-reference="sec:defensecascade">[sec:defensecascade]</a> schemas
predicting imminent threat and powerlessness produce dissociation,
usually via self-produced opioids.

We group the interventions listed here into two categories: deactivating
the avoidance- and dissociation-producing schemas by increasing feelings
of safety, and paying better attention to maladaptive schemas in the
face of avoidance and dissociation. This grouping is done for
organizational simplicity even though the attractor state is naturally
circular. For instance, increasing safety leads to decreased avoidance
and dissociation, which facilitates reconsolidation of the maladaptive
schemas producing avoidance and dissociation, which makes further
reconsolidation easier, etc. Alternatively, starting with increased
attention can lead to reconsolidation, which then reduces avoidance and
dissociation, etc.

MDMA combined with deliberate therapeutic introspection is often
sufficient to deactivate avoidance and dissociation or reconsolidate the
avoidance- and dissociation-producing schemas if they aren’t too
strong (Razvi & Elfrink, 2020). Of course, this is not always the case.

Resolving dissociation may immediately lead to
flight-or-fight (Kozlowska et al., 2015), which we think is much easier
to deal with on MDMA than dissociation.

### Increasing Safety

- A skilled and ethical therapist or guide whom you work well with.

- A higher dose of MDMA, especially if the initial dose was lower than
  the standard dose listed in
  <a href="#sec:dosing" data-reference-type="ref+label"
  data-reference="sec:dosing">[sec:dosing]</a>.

- Non-sexual touch from a trusted person.

- Bringing a non-distracting pet or treasured stuffed animal into the
  session.

- Altering your environment in other ways that help you feel safe.

### Paying Attention

The goal of these items is emotional engagement with maladaptive
schemas. This is a requirement for reconsolidation. Intellectual
thinking about the schemas isn’t sufficient.

- Paying attention to the content of the avoidance. What does the schema
  fear will happen if you feel the thing you’re avoiding? What is the
  inner monologue saying right now?

- Paying attention to the imminent threat and powerlessness schemas that
  produce dissociation. How do they feel?

- A skilled and ethical therapist or guide whom you work well with can
  help you notice and pay attention.

- Mindfulness practices of noticing and staying present with your
  experiences. See and .

- Razvi & Elfrink (2020) reports that a technique they developed called
  *selective inhibition* is highly beneficial.

  The technique involves two parts. First, you suppress all voluntary
  distractions, avoidance, calming techniques, and coping strategies.
  These are things like thoughts and small movements. Second, you focus
  attention on the subtle signs of distress or dissociation in your body
  and mind. This might be muscle tension, fast or slow breathing,
  involuntary movement impulses, fear, anger, hopelessness, or
  irritation. For strong dissociation, these sensations may at first
  just be blankness, flat affect, nothingness, boredom, sleepiness, or
  sobriety. Like in meditation, these sensations are focused on just as
  they are, without trying to interpret or alter them.

  After a period of focus, and presumably reconsolidation[1], during
  which the sensations may grow and dissipate in wave patterns[2], the
  dissociation recedes and transitions to flight-or-flight. Depending on
  the strength of dissociation, anywhere from minutes to a full day-long
  session of selective inhibition is needed.

  This is the core process in their therapeutic method called
  psychedelic somatic interactional psychotherapy (PSIP). We’re unclear
  how achievable this process is in solo MDMA therapy without a
  therapist or guide skilled in the method.

  An MDMA booster dose can extend the session to deal with particularly
  resistant dissociation.

- A trip sitter can remind you to stay focused, though they might not
  have the skill to help you navigate intense avoidance or dissociation.
  They should be trustworthy, emotionally non-reactive, and
  empathetic (Thal et al., 2022).

- People often use emotionally evocative music to help them engage with
  their maladaptive schemas. Searching for “MDMA therapy” on Spotify or
  Apple Music will show many playlists made for this purpose.

### Other Options

MDMA therapy may not always be able to resolve dissociation. Saj Razvi,
founder of the Psychedelic Somatic Institute, recommends that people
with strong dissociation will find MDMA therapy more productive if they
start with three sessions of cannabis-assisted PSIP (Personal
communication, Saj Razvi, Jan. 2, 2026). They find that cannabis is a
particularly good complement for selective inhibition, possibly because
it impairs voluntary control of the experience, though that factor also
makes the process more difficult to do solo (Razvi & Elfrink, 2020). The
maintains a directory of therapists (Psychedelic Somatic Institute,
2024).

[1] They don’t frame the process in terms of reconsolidation, but we
think it is clearly facilitating reconsolidation.

[2] We speculate that each wave is the activation and reconsolidation of
an individual dissociation-producing schema.
