MDMA therapy is a powerful tool for

- healing mental illness

- connecting with yourself, those you love, and the world

- resolving conflict

- developing equanimity, patience, compassion, introspection,
  resilience, alignment of behavior with goals, and cognitive and
  emotional flexibility

- unburdening from hypervigilance, fear, chronic stress, loneliness,
  shame, guilt, etc.

- focusing on what you can change and letting go of the things you can’t

There is moderate-quality clinical trial evidence that a limited course
of MDMA therapy is highly effective for durably resolving PTSD, not just
managing its symptoms. However, we think there are good theoretical
reasons and ample anecdotal and clinical reports indicating that MDMA
therapy can also resolve the psychological part of most mental illnesses
and emotional issues. This includes CPTSD, non-secure attachment,
anxiety, addiction, obsessions, eating disorders, ADHD, depression,
somatic symptom disorders, personality disorders, dissociation, panic,
and more. Some instances of these issues may have biological components
that MDMA therapy does not address.

As of 2025, MDMA has not been approved by most medical regulators. There
is disagreement over whether existing clinical trials were sufficient to
approve MDMA for medical use (Schenberg, 2024). The US FDA thought the
existing evidence was insufficient and requested one more
trial (Psychedelic Alpha, 2025), but a Dutch state commission determined
that “Scientific research has shown that MDMA-AT is an effective and
safe treatment method. …The State Commission deems it desirable that
this treatment method become available in the Netherlands as soon as
possible” (Toebes et al., 2024). Possession of MDMA is a felony in most
jurisdictions, though it often isn’t an enforcement priority. The vast
majority of MDMA therapy in 2025 is done underground, though there are
also clinical trials and special access programs in certain countries.
The following assumes that MDMA therapy works as we believe it does and
that it isn’t just a particularly effective placebo that may stop
working when people’s expectations for it subside.

### A Working Model of the Types of Issues MDMA Therapy Seems to Address

Our brains continually learn beliefs (e.g., “I can’t do anything right,”
“I am bad”), emotional reactions, memories, and behavioral patterns to
move through the world and thrive (Ecker et al., 2024). Different
therapeutic frameworks group these components into units called schemas,
parts, trauma reactions, priors, etc., because the components seem to
act as an integrated whole rather than separate things. Occasionally,
the schemas we learn to survive in one context become maladaptive in
another context. This often starts when we learn particularly deep,
pervasive, negative, and resilient schemas about ourselves, other
people, and relationships to survive emotionally or physically insecure
childhoods. Once we shift out of that context, like when we become
adults, a wide variety of circumstances trigger those old schemas,
resulting in fear, anxiety, anger, depression, panic, etc. in situations
where those reactions are no longer helpful.

Strong schemas of imminent threat and powerlessness also cause our
nervous systems to activate the defensive states of arousal,
fight-or-flight, freeze, and dissociation (Kozlowska et al., 2015).

Our brains have an update process that, in normal circumstances,
gradually modifies schemas to become adaptive to different
situations (Ecker et al., 2024). Unfortunately, some things can inhibit
this process, like dissociation, fight-or-flight, avoidance (often
unconscious), and lack of time or emotional capacity (Bergh et al.,
2021; Kozlowska et al., 2015). Exceptionally strong schemas also seem
resistant to updating, perhaps because they are too overwhelming to be
present with. For example, in PTSD, there is an exceptionally strong
belief of imminent danger that doesn’t update when the danger passes.

### How MDMA Therapy Works

MDMA seems to start the previously blocked update process for any
maladaptive schema you activate or trigger during the session and then
stay present with. Thinking, writing, or talking about your issue is
often sufficient to do this. After the schema updates, it will not
reactivate after the session is over, though complex schemas have
numerous parts that you have to individually update. Dissociation,
arousal, freeze, and fight-or-flight also resolve once you update the
underlying schemas.

This is a powerful process but is not a quick fix except for simple
issues. People typically need to do a lot of between-session
therapy-like work as well as multiple sessions. Resolving the most
severe issues will take years of hard work.

Psychological destabilization is likely the most significant downside.
It is a common and probably often unavoidable phase of therapy for those
with severe trauma but is actually associated with greater improvement
later in the therapeutic process (Olthof et al., 2020). Unfortunately,
people are sometimes not explicitly aware they have gone through severe
trauma. This may happen if that trauma takes the form of disorganized
attachment (assess with
[attachmentproject.com](https://www.attachmentproject.com)), the abuse
is explained away as cultural tradition or “how things are,” the trauma
took place in the period of childhood amnesia, or it is not remembered
for some reason. Diagnosis of mental illness indicates higher risk as
well.

*Destabilization is occasionally long and overwhelming and can cause
major problems when poorly managed or entered into at an inappropriate
moment in your life.* It may also, on rare occasion, exacerbate or
activate dangerous symptoms like psychosis or suicide attempts. People
with a history of those may especially benefit from skilled, ethical,
and well-matched professional support. Check out the Challenging
Psychedelic Experiences Project for help:
[challengingpsychedelicexperiences.com](https://challengingpsychedelicexperiences.com).

MDMA-assisted therapy tends to speed up both healing and
destabilization. Additional MDMA sessions and regular therapy often help
work through destabilization. Connecting with other people who have had
similar experiences also helps.

Destabilization is sometimes caused by experiences that feel like
remembering apparently forgotten memories. Unfortunately, there is no
way to determine how accurate these memories are other than independent
corroboration. See
[psychedelicsandrecoveredmemories.com](https://psychedelicsandrecoveredmemories.com)
for more information.

### Sessions

A standard, safe dose is 100 mg for body masses less than 60 kg (132 lb)
and 125 mg for more (Baggott, 2015; Liechti & Schmid, 2023). People over
75 years old also start with 100 mg. These doses can be adjusted later
to fit individual circumstances. Low doses generally don’t work. A
regular dose might not be sufficient for severe dissociation or panic.
Too high of a dose might be so blissful that you can’t engage with your
trauma reactions.

Booster doses half the strength of the initial dose are sometimes taken
1.5–2.5 hours later to extend the session length. This has worked well
in large clinical trials with no obvious, reported adverse effects.
However, there is a lower degree of certainty that these higher total
doses are safe for more than a handful of sessions (Baggott, 2015). We
think booster doses are fine to start off with, but that once people
have established a reliably therapeutic routine, they gradually reduce
their dose to find their *minimum effective dose.*

The general strategy during the session is to emotionally activate your
anxieties, depression, panic, etc., then stay with that feeling,
regardless of what it is. If you have the right dose of MDMA and aren’t
dissociating, the feeling should gradually dissipate. That’s the
updating process at work.

For dissociation, some clinicians recommend “…bringing blankness, flat
affect, nothingness, boredom, sleepiness, or sobriety \[the subjective
feelings of dissociation\] into focus” (Razvi & Elfrink, 2020). Then,
“…it might take staying with it from minutes to a full day-long session,
but it will crack.” A skilled, ethical, and well-matched professional
may also be especially helpful here.

People often need the whole following day to recover, and aftereffects
may last a few days. It’s also important to spend significant amounts of
time in the following days and weeks attending to your emotional
changes.

It’s common to experience moderately increased psychological turmoil and
adverse symptoms for days to weeks after a session. MDMA helps us
confront distressing feelings that we have been avoiding, and our minds
can feel distressed about that until we process those feelings and
reactions. It’s often worthwhile developing a set of healthy coping
practices to help you through this period.

The Fireside Project offers a hotline to help people through challenging
psychedelic experiences at +1 (623) 473-7433 in the USA or in their app
in Canada. [tripsit.me/webchat](https://tripsit.me/webchat) is a
chatroom available anywhere.

There is almost no data on how frequently it is safe to do sessions,
though many people have strong opinions on the subject nonetheless. In
the absence of better data, the 6 week spacing used in the clinical
trials might be a reasonable minimum.

### Working with a Guide or Therapist

It’s helpful to start MDMA therapy with a skilled, ethical, and
well-matched professional, at least to learn the basics. Some people
have success starting off solo, but it’s usually harder and riskier. A
trip sitter who is trusted, experienced, empathetic, and emotionally
non-reactive can also be helpful.

There are a few important factors when working with a guide, therapist,
or other mental health professional:

- Ethical: They should inform you of the benefits and risks, not abuse
  you, and maintain strict professional boundaries. Occasionally guides
  and therapists abuse their clients. Be extra cautious with anyone if
  you feel something is off, they aren’t committed to strict
  professional boundaries, or you see any other red flags. Touch or love
  from the therapist are not essential healing components of MDMA
  therapy. You can always video record your session or bring a trusted
  friend or family member along. For more information on red flags, see
  Friedwoman et al. (2025).

- Skilled: They should have thorough knowledge of, and experience
  successfully resolving, a wide spectrum of difficult situations that
  might arise during MDMA therapy. This especially includes intense
  dissociation, avoidance, panic, and destabilization.

- Well-matched: You get along well with them.

You can use the Brief Revised Working Alliance Inventory
([greenspacehealth.com/en-us/br-wai](https://greenspacehealth.com/en-us/br-wai))
to assess your relationship with your guide or therapist.

### Medical, Psychological, and Drug Interaction Risks

A limited course of MDMA therapy is generally well-tolerated for healthy
people, but there are dangerous drug/supplement/herb interactions,
medical contraindications, side effects, and psychological risks:

#### Always Avoid (significant risk of death or irreversible damage):

- MAOIs and ayahuasca

- ritonavir, cobicistat, or HIV drugs that contain them

- combined lifetime use of MDMA and medium–high dose psychedelics over
  125 tablets

- hyperthyroidism that isn’t “well managed and mild,” as assessed by a
  doctor (Mitchell et al., 2023)

#### Use Caution With:

- a family or personal history of psychosis or mania

- a history of addiction to amphetamines or cocaine

- total doses over 2 mg/kg for more than a handful of sessions

- session spacing less than 6 weeks

- drugs/medications/supplements/herbs, including large doses of
  caffeine.

- liver and cardiovascular problems

- other serious medical conditions, especially ones that are not “well
  managed and mild,” as assessed by a doctor (Mitchell et al., 2023)

- a history of bad reactions to amphetamines

#### Take Precaution:

- Don’t drink more than 0.5 L of water during the six hours of the
  session unless you need to replace large amounts of sweat (Groeneveld
  & Harper, 2025).

- Avoid SSRIs and SNRIs for 2 months (ideally) prior.

- Test your MDMA. The presence of some common adulterants can be checked
  with reagent test kits;
  [/r/ReagentTesting/wiki/test_kit_suppliers](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReagentTesting/wiki/test_kit_suppliers)
  maintains a list of suppliers. Laboratory testing is much better;
  [/r/ReagentTesting/wiki/labs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReagentTesting/wiki/labs)
  maintains a list of labs. It measures the amount of MDMA and all other
  ingredients but is harder to access depending on where you live.

- Prepare robust psychological support if you have severe trauma,
  diagnosed mental illness, or severely disorganized attachment.

- MDMA and therapy exhaustion can impair awareness and reaction times.
  Avoid driving and other risky activities on the same day as the
  session.
